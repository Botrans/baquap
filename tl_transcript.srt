1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:12:45,191
Well we are. Yes today.

2
00:12:45,191 --> 00:13:00,135
How to wear like hell. With someone who thought I should do it. Call out to someone who was angry and wondering what to do.

3
00:13:00,135 --> 00:13:15,143
The children got together.

4
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:30,107
I'm thinking of explaining the rules after having them introduce themselves, so I'll go up in order.

5
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:45,041
Yes.

6
00:13:45,041 --> 00:14:15,057
gorilla.

7
00:14:15,057 --> 00:14:30,130
I know it well.

8
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:45,100
Schisandra chinensis.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,099
This is the Amagi store gorilla, also known as the Tenma gorilla.

10
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:45,100
Then next. Is there a way to sit on a banana if I stand up?

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:01:15,160
I want to go to my wife. Then next morning Gori-chan.

12
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:30,154
It's 5 o'clock in the morning. Thank you.

13
00:01:30,154 --> 00:01:45,152
Then singing Gorimi-chan. I'm hoping that it will be thrown in outer space.

14
00:01:45,152 --> 00:02:00,116
Kagura Suzu-chan Good morning.

15
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:15,118
Cartoon. I've never sprayed it.

16
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:30,205
I also practiced sabotage, but since this is my first time online, I might ask him to pull a boy. A typhoon is coming.

17
00:02:30,205 --> 00:02:45,108
You're watching. For projects like hell.

18
00:02:45,108 --> 00:03:15,175
Gorilla-kun Gorilla-chan Welcome back. everyone.

19
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:30,046

20
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:45,128
Today's important and important rules.

21
00:03:45,128 --> 00:04:00,115
More than a head. it's great.

22
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:15,138
This is the rule issued by Zeami.

23
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:30,140
I'm Ell Yes, basically the only words I can speak are on the right side.

24
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:45,186
All the conjunctions are lies, so thank you. When everyone is angry with LINE, I don't know who they are, so I can say my name.

25
00:04:45,186 --> 00:05:00,125
Please note that I cannot say.

26
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:15,117
I used to say shit to Yuki, which means that Yukin's sister is saying now. All colors are red this time.

27
00:05:15,117 --> 00:05:30,153
Yukimi-neechan and red and green were together.

28
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:45,187
And from the beginning, all the places like cafeterias and weapons. I can't say whether it's an event or not.

29
00:05:45,187 --> 00:06:00,147
I can't say any other words with 1, so it's a proper noun such as a weapon.

30
00:06:00,147 --> 00:06:15,115
It's like I was in a weapon.

31
00:06:15,115 --> 00:07:00,074
Who is that area? Because I can't.

32
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:15,123
Who is that area?

33
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:30,143
After taking the difference, it's finished cleaning up.

34
00:07:30,143 --> 00:07:45,148
My task.

35
00:07:45,148 --> 00:08:00,191
Or when you press the middle button.

36
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:15,160
It's okay, though. Gorilla Why is it okay?

37
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:30,113
It 's okay, everyone is Hongo today. I'm pretty suspicious of people tomorrow.

38
00:08:30,113 --> 00:08:45,138
Make me hungry. Let's meet the apps you don't use.

39
00:08:45,138 --> 00:09:00,152
It doesn't matter, but if you say something other than half.

40
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:15,176
If you utter a word other than as an added word. If there were so many coolers.

41
00:09:15,176 --> 00:09:30,093
Have a gorilla put in.

42
00:09:30,093 --> 00:10:00,103
You can speak the key normally.

43
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:15,165
I think it would be really funny to talk, but there are some fat gorillas who are a little hard to talk to.

44
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:45,126
What did you buy that banana, but why was the banana added before that? When everyone likes it.

45
00:10:45,126 --> 00:11:15,146
First of all, 8 The sleeping rules are over.

46
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:45,098

00:12:00,123 --> 00:12:30,115
Then 8 Hidden Hidden 10 When it's time to speak normally. Please move properly. Mute the speaker when it starts.

49
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:45,172
If a corpse is found, mute normally. It's okay

50
00:12:45,172 --> 00:13:15,086
Arora again. With everyone. There was.

51
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:30,120

55
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:30,161
No task is finished.

56
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:45,143
Maybe I've never suffered from such a disturbing chat.

57
00:14:45,143 --> 00:15:00,092
Your lyrics.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,082

After killing her. I ran over here with the demon.

79
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:45,127
I think it's food and you may be.

80
00:09:45,127 --> 00:10:00,124
Was strong today.

81
00:10:00,124 --> 00:10:15,152
I wonder if it's difficult to enter digit numbers. I felt like I couldn't make it in time to cure it in a hurry.

82
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:30,144
When you're against it, you'll be alone in outer space.

83
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:45,143
Maybe you're smart. I don't think it works.

84
00:10:45,143 --> 00:11:00,095
Welcome back, Mr. Gorilla.

85
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:15,121

iPhone 2.

87
00:11:45,134 --> 00:12:00,104
It was a place that suddenly opened.

88
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:15,150
Are you with Aisa's Gorimi-chan? I don't think everyone knows.

89
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:30,131
Gorilla rose. I passed by Akaaka. As a red gorilla who passed by.

90
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:45,153
It's a little scary because it overlaps with red and red.

91
00:12:45,153 --> 00:13:00,145
That's why it's done. not a lie. Mitoku.

92

The spirit world is about to come out. Who did I do? I was killed by Rigori-chan.

109
00:06:45,143 --> 00:07:00,106
It's no good not to be a gorilla.

110
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:15,123
Boston is not old enough to protect himself.

111
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:30,131
I'm a little disappointed I'm losing now.

112
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:45,123
So I didn't become a gorilla with 7. I'm leaving it, isn't it? It's always the case. You might win this game.

Yeah, I'm going to sleep again.

121
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:45,112
My sister hasn't attended any gorilla conference right now, why?

122
00:10:45,112 --> 00:11:00,116

I think it's Yurika, but it's a kanji that somehow catches in-posters.

128
00:13:45,160 --> 00:14:15,132
You're an easy-to-use banana you've already eaten. I was dating because I couldn't speak Japanese.

129
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:30,140
It can not be helped. I'm glad I added it together.

130
00:14:30,140 --> 00:15:00,115
Would you like to go again?

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,102
Look for that sabotage button sabotage. Come out.

132
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:30,128
What is it? There is a cool time and I can't press it.

There is no fault and most leave without understanding the situation. If I pray, can't I do this one?

141
00:05:00,122 --> 00:05:15,099
Even if I wasn't doing it, I got two when there was nobody, but I couldn't do it.

142
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:30,134
I've been waiting, but there is no such thing. Let's go to a good place. It's really low, isn't it?

143
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:45,076
I'm not saying I'm doing this.

144
00:05:45,076 --> 00:06:00,085
I'm pretending to be carving.

145
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:15,047

When you look at it, it looks like before.

152
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:45,147
It's a great hindrance because it can be dyed at the right time.

153
00:09:45,147 --> 00:10:00,102

00:02:45,047 --> 00:03:00,125

I was suspicious of Dorami-chan, so I told him to follow along.

215
00:03:30,111 --> 00:04:00,169
Only the male gorilla is on the right.

216
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:15,129
Time is over.

217

Some people have spoken words that they didn't have.

218
00:04:30,107 --> 00:05:00,147
I can't even understand that. Gorilla is still a while.

219
00:05:00,147 --> 00:05:15,180
Please put the gorilla state in the icon or name for a while.

220
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:30,114
What should I do?

221
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:45,158
This is the first Kagura Suzu-chan game like this. I can't work overtime for 4 hours.

Please say Kazo and Oguchi. Then, Gorilla, please. You and me.

I'm playing a game of shooting people with a gun.

226
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:30,127
Well then, next Aki-chan. Half gorilla.

227
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:45,178
That's right, I don't understand the game so much that I don't understand anything. I didn't know anything, but it was a good experience to try hard to communicate later.

228
00:07:45,178 --> 00:08:00,144
It was a werewolf game. I thought it was a lot of fun.

229
00:08:00,144 --> 00:08:15,123
To make a gorilla line.

00:08:30,142 --> 00:09:00,113
It wasn't in Kyoto, and I was always foolish, but first of all, I made two discoveries today, and after that, the name is always fun. You may go home.

232
00:09:00,113 --> 00:09:15,139
It's okay, so even if you can't speak very well, you can do it in the same atmosphere, and this time it's pre.

233
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:30,115
That's right, it means that only bananas pushed Cocos. It's smart though.

234
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:45,138
On the night of one. The other day, I did it with Ami-chan in that time.

235
00:09:45,138 --> 00:10:00,164
It was decided that I would let the girls-only gathering go even if I went properly. Please wait 27.

00:12:15,154 --> 00:12:45,145
I want to shorten the meeting time in the Neya properly. The banana I thought was messed up.

243
00:12:45,145 --> 00:13:00,147
Bananas of various colors come out. Pins and bananas are dangerous.

244
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:30,106
It's an announcement, but a little. It's okay because it takes a little time.

245
00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:45,124
Added in February. It's a gorilla.

246
00:13:45,124 --> 00:14:00,093
I'm going to a motorcycle. Then next morning, the rest is yes.

247
00:14:00,093 --> 00:14:15,093
What is serotonin?

248
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:30,070
It's necessary to prepare mentally.

249
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:45,140
I was very happy to invite you. Thank you, Kimi-neechan. The day after tomorrow, the 27th, I'll be announcing a new family. Yes.

250
00:14:45,140 --> 00:15:00,100
Your family will grow. It's a black photo.

Chau Taiko Rimi-chan. Thank you very much.

252
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:30,106
Didn't you leave a human?

253
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:45,085
Yes, do your best.

254
00:00:45,085 --> 00:01:00,090
Thank you. I'm going to play golf properly.

255
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:15,084
Suzu-chan.

256
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:30,115
I often go out during meetings. It's okay because I turned off the sound.

257
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:45,116
I want to try again after deepening my understanding.

258
00:01:45,116 --> 00:02:00,114
Gorilla image. Revenge.

259
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:30,157
Search by gorilla. I want to liven up this high.

260
00:02:30,157 --> 00:02:45,117
I wonder if I'm going.

261
00:02:45,117 --> 00:03:30,133
It would be helpful if you could check it, so please take a look.

262
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:45,133
Yes Yes Yes Yes Last everyone really the same 5. It was really fun, but I'm an alien normally.

263
00:03:45,133 --> 00:04:00,133
I'm tired from 1 o'clock. Gorilla Gorilla.

264
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:15,094
Shall we go with guinea pigs next time?

265
00:04:15,094 --> 00:04:30,066
will you do.

266
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:45,183

267
00:04:45,183 --> 00:05:00,154
I want to get together and have a poop. That's really true.

268
00:05:00,154 --> 00:05:15,097
Baby on the stomach.

269
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:30,126
You've used it until now. Absolutely eat.

270
00:05:30,126 --> 00:05:45,115
The banana feels good, so I'll go to the end.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:09:00,143
Arona.

I used to be a gorilla, but sometimes with a gorilla and a kilo. What do you want to do?

274
00:09:30,082 --> 00:09:45,129
Do you want That's right. While sleeping.

275
00:09:45,129 --> 00:10:00,130
That baby baby. But though.

276
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:15,132
Goldfish Hunposi. I think I have a cat. Words and deeds.

277
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:30,107
I'm curious, but let's take a look. The inventory I have already given up is bread bread. I can't see it.

278
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:45,095
The aquarium looks delicious.

279
00:10:45,095 --> 00:11:00,094
The sound of the company is an important job. It's amazing here, the whole thing.

280
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:15,097
I'd like to see it, but it's amazing. The interior is quite made and it's baseball channel 2.

281
00:11:15,097 --> 00:11:30,152
I thought I would plant some flowers for picking flowers. I've lost everything I do.

282
00:11:30,152 --> 00:11:45,082
I wonder what happened I saw this here.

283
00:11:45,082 --> 00:12:00,137
Thank you very much. This is a box that has been 8 years old.

284
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:15,161
It's scary. I was surprised to be trapped.

285
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:30,156
Don't get close to 10 You'll get burned if you get close. There is also a beautiful toilet that sounds like a diamond.

286
00:12:30,156 --> 00:12:45,133
gardening. That's right, me. There were a lot of cats and cats.

287
00:12:45,133 --> 00:13:00,105
Because it is made with a good feeling. I'd like either one.

288
00:13:00,105 --> 00:13:15,113
Do you think Chika is good?

289
00:13:15,113 --> 00:13:30,097
But it's okay.

290
00:13:30,097 --> 00:13:45,134
I thought about this for a moment.

291
00:13:45,134 --> 00:14:00,112
8 times with a pipe. I'm afraid that an accident that I shouldn't touch there will occur.

292
00:14:00,112 --> 00:14:15,089
Is it nearby?

293
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:30,139
I have a lot of vegetables. I'm a little worried about where to go from here.

294
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:45,090
this. The entrance to the basement. There is only a wooden pickaxe.

295
00:14:45,090 --> 00:15:00,105
I feel like someone has attacked me.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,048
Thank you.

297
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:30,126
Diamond pickaxe. Would you like to participate with this? Employees are supporting each other.

298
00:00:30,126 --> 00:00:45,107
Entrance door.

299
00:00:45,107 --> 00:01:00,097
I'm expecting it.

300
00:01:00,097 --> 00:01:30,097
Did it come out? Where can I do it?

301
00:01:30,097 --> 00:01:45,125
This sharpness.

302
00:01:45,125 --> 00:02:00,107
I really ordered the toilet baby baby.

303
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:15,157
Speaking of which.

304
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:30,122
Don't come.

305
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:45,103
That's what it is.

306
00:02:45,103 --> 00:03:00,122
I think I was able to prove it by something. I wonder if this and the underground are also included. I wonder if it's not approaching at all yet.

307
00:03:00,122 --> 00:03:15,118
Near this. But this is the ceiling.

308
00:03:15,118 --> 00:03:30,118
But when it goes down. One thing.

309
00:03:30,118 --> 00:03:45,046
This is different.

310
00:03:45,046 --> 00:04:00,086
The skirt is amazing.

311
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:30,091
It's Okinawa. Make a space.

312
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:45,128
I can see the outside. Only the exterior is solid. Where to look.

313
00:04:45,128 --> 00:05:00,116
This kind of atmosphere.

314
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:15,137
There are so many people.

315
00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:30,168
I wonder if I should sleep today, and the place is stupid with 2 putts. Because I thought.

316
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:45,099
The workbench. What do you want. It is being installed more and more.

317
00:05:45,099 --> 00:06:00,079
Hit one thing you want to make.

318
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:15,122
It's already been 10 years since it rained. I wonder if it's missing over here.

319
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:30,127
How to dry this a lot.

320
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:45,112
Like a glass atrium. How big is the room?

321
00:06:45,112 --> 00:07:00,129
This is Takasugi, a health center.

322
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:15,102
Because it's selling. It's amazing, it's crispy. I wonder if it's a company that was required to be ready for action.

323
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:30,119
Neatly raised and picked fish.

324
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:45,086
This is too wide.

325
00:07:45,086 --> 00:08:00,158
But as two, I'm planning on that much.

326
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:15,117
It's about here. Because he made the wall so far.

327
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:30,119
Hiro of Puni Koma. Well, that president also becomes a tadbit.

328
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:45,111
Grab your weaknesses.

329
00:08:45,111 --> 00:09:00,155
There are various types of female spies who haven't gotten any information. Where did you go

330
00:09:00,155 --> 00:09:15,110
Which child will not be destroyed? A white cat with only the edges around it. Do you want to powder it?

331
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:30,088
It's gone, isn't it?

332
00:09:30,088 --> 00:09:45,127
It didn't rain.

333
00:09:45,127 --> 00:10:00,137
This is just a design mistake. Cat punch.

334
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:15,105
There is a possibility if it is about this from here.

335
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:30,112
Takenoyama. Take-chan also wants more power from Keiko Toda.

336
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:45,131
I thought I'd just send my mind to Keiko Toda.

337
00:10:45,131 --> 00:11:00,099
It's the same white. Because I'm also fashionable.

338
00:11:00,099 --> 00:11:15,087
Don't say no.

339
00:11:15,087 --> 00:11:30,172
