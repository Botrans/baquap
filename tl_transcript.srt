1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,622
That was it. Insanely hide. A shit-like match.

2
00:00:19,622 --> 00:00:34,653
I've seen ranran. That's right.

3
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:49,584
If you always look at it, don't do it like usual. I'm sorry here. I'm doing it here.

4
00:00:49,584 --> 00:01:04,622
What weapon do you use? I have 45. I'll give you a bolt.

5
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:19,590
That one.

6
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:34,620
You can make it. Yeah.

7
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:49,629
God body armor. I can fight, but thank you.

8
00:01:49,629 --> 00:02:04,617
If you have the key to the vault, you may be able to make a pack.

9
00:02:04,617 --> 00:02:19,617
I have to go to. It looks reliable now. This is not good.

10
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:34,601
The one who had fun was the last one I went to, though.

11
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:49,668
Kazumasa Oda That's right before, you can eat this. If you think it's a match, I want to buy it.

12
00:02:49,668 --> 00:03:04,604
The story is one month. I was doing notes. OK, I'll follow you.

13
00:03:04,604 --> 00:03:19,641
I'll finish running. What to use 7 seasons 8

14
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:34,640
The gold cornea came out and came out. Is it a replacement?

15
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:49,649
I wonder if that is the case. Mylord And it's in the settings, like auto-reload when it's 7 or 0. I'm doing.

16
00:03:49,649 --> 00:04:04,630
Each one is outside. With the blue armor Horizon.

17
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:19,614
Aoyama's wife. There is no AWA there.

18
00:04:19,614 --> 00:04:34,628
Let's proceed.

19
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:49,643
I'm still in the 2nd par, so I'm in the back there. I want to defeat Horizon.

20
00:04:49,643 --> 00:05:04,623
Otenten Kore Idare Style Style One person crypto is doing it.

21
00:05:04,623 --> 00:05:19,638
Be cute. I got a flower.

22
00:05:19,638 --> 00:05:34,713
I'm a little scared to rotate the shield recharge.

23
00:05:34,713 --> 00:05:49,694
I wonder what happened to Air's jib stage, but I think I'll be back again, but I'm fine at all. Go down. Where are you going because I'll let you come and go home?

24
00:05:49,694 --> 00:06:19,610
Oh yeah, it's okay around here anymore. I wonder if it will end in the store and be dyed. That's right again. Let's collect my corpse. once again.

25
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:34,611
It's okay.

26
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:49,638
I'll do it. me too. Someone seen from above.

27
00:06:49,638 --> 00:07:04,616
My pain is on the other side until it hurts somewhere.

28
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:19,632
I want a shielded battery. If it's small, it's huge. Nothing, no, where did you recover this?

29
00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:34,613
The death growl around here and the day after tomorrow, maybe. The little one.

30
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:49,605
Something. Let's go to Goda's house. energy.

31
00:07:49,605 --> 00:08:04,643
Here. strongest. I wish I were alone. Where did you go? I wonder if I went to this area.

32
00:08:04,643 --> 00:08:19,595
Do you want to do it?

33
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:34,618
It's raining, isn't it? no.

34
00:08:34,618 --> 00:08:49,673
Ujien It's a little geyser, so it's cute, maybe it's okay to head for the family. I'll forgive you. Layout Today's wash, which one.

35
00:08:49,673 --> 00:09:04,629
Should I go? It's a free day.

36
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:19,587
Yes Yes Yes Yes. As it is. OK from tomorrow.

37
00:09:19,587 --> 00:09:34,611
Start-up. I don't even remember.

38
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:49,627
It's a fish, but I think there wasn't anyone in this solid direction, right? Love. If it's wonderful, say something like this. Is it alright.

39
00:09:49,627 --> 00:10:04,625
That country rapper. I'm doing it, though the ult is cooked.

40
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:19,634
Don't enter here. Ok Oh. Isn't it the one from earlier? Is it coming from there? Blue You see, it looks like it's coming in.

41
00:10:19,634 --> 00:10:34,607
OK. I'll stick it.

42
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:49,587
I don't have a sniper.

43
00:10:49,587 --> 00:11:04,601
Hey, be careful here. It's a geyser.

44
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:19,638
That's it, do you want to eat each other's attacks? Not like that. It's like losing.

45
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:34,669
There is no such thing as exchanging Munakata damage for fighting games. I'm here because I can't do anything. Ochi Town I'm moving.

46
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:49,624
Anyway. St. Kashiwa. I won't come.

47
00:11:49,624 --> 00:12:04,605
What do you have

48
00:12:04,605 --> 00:12:19,623
Maybe I'll make a visit to the store later. Take me to a safe place.

49
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:49,586
It's ok. I want to eat it. It 's good. I want to.

50
00:12:49,586 --> 00:13:04,609
I think my mother should be careful too. It's a move. It looks like it will be fine.

51
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:19,668
OK leave it to me. I wonder if it's everywhere I'm in there.

52
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:34,608
There is also such a face. I'm also in this. I'm sorry.

53
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:49,660
I can see you It hurts I went here. I want to get 3 yen.

54
00:13:49,660 --> 00:14:04,648
Good luck with that. Give it up.

55
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:19,632
There is a possibility. An email that goes inside as soon as you enter.

56
00:14:19,632 --> 00:14:34,634
North Sea is here. We are full pa.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:15:12,746
Such a thing. I'm being chased.

58
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:27,686
I entered twice.

59
00:15:27,686 --> 00:15:42,749
You can beat it, maybe. I have two people.

60
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:57,740
I can help you.

61
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:12,718
Just bring it. I decided to follow Mokamon Haru-san.

62
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:27,775
Champion and Rose Carry it out. yet. That's right because you end up talking.

63
00:16:27,775 --> 00:16:42,734
It's slow, it's slow, I think it's slow.

64
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:57,736
I developed my theory, but money. Someone who gets up around 12 o'clock.

65
00:16:57,736 --> 00:17:12,785
Maybe I slept around midnight and around 6am. I have to shift the time of eating rice by 6 hours.

66
00:17:12,785 --> 00:17:27,774
Eating lunch at 17:00 I think it's healthy to eat rice around 22:00. Yes Yes Yes. Ara-san's recent.

67
00:17:27,774 --> 00:17:42,749
What is the time route? Who is the love singer Haru-san? The natural school of eating.

68
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:57,741
Be the number one in the morning and night. Morning, day and night.

69
00:17:57,741 --> 00:18:12,797
I know who got into the water. I wish I could have done it. I wonder what it is. I borrowed it.

70
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:27,717
If I still can't stand it. Even my dad can enter the corner.

71
00:18:27,717 --> 00:18:42,725
I like it. I have no clothes. I'll be back tomorrow.

72
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:57,700
No. 24.

73
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:12,749
This is mine. Others are good. That's it.

74
00:19:12,749 --> 00:19:27,709
I'm going to shoot through the gap under the container and make it naughty. No, it's naughty.

75
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:42,788
Russell 4th. It's a mess that can be done because it's a store.

76
00:19:42,788 --> 00:19:57,751
I see. Bolts. Evolution shield.

77
00:19:57,751 --> 00:20:12,801
Don't take it, it's rock. Mr. Toma, why do you make a sound? I just wanted to compete.

78
00:20:12,801 --> 00:20:27,720
Eggplant. The time I'm doing is a little early. It's early, a little Otaru.

79
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:42,707
I wonder if there isn't. I'm thinking.

80
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:57,730
Please wait. There is no such thing. Let's go OK. I already believe in alsa.

81
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:12,765
Shiina It's like Kishida It's like a knight. At all in sex.

82
00:21:12,765 --> 00:21:27,733
Just being with me is from the enemy. You. It looks like it's open.

83
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:42,748
I thought it wasn't there, but it looks like it's gone. Above.

84
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:57,783
That's why I wonder if the other side said maybe that's right.

85
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:12,908
Various various. I can't use mobile.

86
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:27,742
Alkaiser. Poor positioning. I'm making it now.

87
00:22:27,742 --> 00:22:42,745
I can't forgive that moe. It's extreme right now behind this container.

88
00:22:42,745 --> 00:22:57,770
It's raining, so you may not be able to dig in too much. This one isn't open either.

89
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:12,758
It's okay, I'm not that. OK go now.

90
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:27,755
Oh yeah yeah yeah. If you ask me over here. I wonder what happened to the one who sent it.

91
00:23:27,755 --> 00:23:42,761
The day after tomorrow is fine. Shamine. Cup Yassa.

92
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:57,700
Yes. I'm talking about home security.

93
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:12,760
Wait, money here. I don't know.

94
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:27,747
That's right, I'm somewhere, I can't get something, I'm not coming out, is there? I'm not stupid, you see, I'm being struck.

95
00:24:27,747 --> 00:24:42,731
Over there. It was enough cash to go right next to it.

96
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:57,747
69 on the body. Wait a minute. I'm sorry I want you to come out with armor.

97
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:12,739
What are you doing? The real child who stole it. Is it a companion?

98
00:25:12,739 --> 00:25:27,784
I think it's okay to go back with this character.

99
00:25:27,784 --> 00:25:42,771
Let's become a mess. Ya-kun's. Well I slash.

100
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:57,753
Each one is a base one. It's blue-blue rain.

101
00:25:57,753 --> 00:26:12,744
I went to the left house on the left. where did you go. I have it from behind the fireflies. Pull once.

102
00:26:12,744 --> 00:26:27,791
Yukana. It might be dangerous if you don't go all the way to the back. This is the engraved sky. For the time being, Rian.

103
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:42,728
I want to go to the street address. He was a child who followed the video once.

104
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:57,771
The voice will fall asleep first.

105
00:26:57,771 --> 00:27:12,728
Well, it's because it leaks from the house. There may be others. That's my field I'll do my best to grow it.

106
00:27:12,728 --> 00:27:27,672
here we go.

107
00:27:27,672 --> 00:27:42,735
I want to fight, but something like that seal video. Do you want to attack a little?

108
00:27:42,735 --> 00:27:57,745
That's right today. You didn't do that. inner.

109
00:27:57,745 --> 00:28:12,774
It goes into the back of the pipe with the bad guy. I think I'll be here too.

110
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:27,716
Just a little more OK. I'm strong.

111
00:28:27,716 --> 00:28:42,770
Yoshio on the move I'm on the move.

112
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:57,738
I'm strong. Sometimes I get double.

113
00:28:57,738 --> 00:29:12,769
A stray bullet is coming from the back.

114
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:27,728
I think it's about recovery.

115
00:29:27,728 --> 00:29:42,744
Haru-san and Ueno are good places. I'm going.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:29:59,826
Let's find a hotel. I'll bring it.

117
00:29:59,826 --> 00:30:14,752
Hoge-chan.

118
00:30:14,752 --> 00:30:29,830
salt. wake me up. I think it's because of my apex.

119
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:44,828
Maybe it wasn't because of my mind. It's because of my mind. I'm definitely there.

120
00:30:44,828 --> 00:30:59,871
It's an important unread thing. Yeah, yeah, hey, hey, it's open, I'm here. Sunny and Sunny.

121
00:30:59,871 --> 00:31:14,824
You're here OK, maybe.

122
00:31:14,824 --> 00:31:29,829
Because I'm heading from the paella stand.

123
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:44,817
I wonder if it will come from the other side. not good.

124
00:31:44,817 --> 00:31:59,839
Enter the area where Kiterne is included and head for it.

125
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:14,822
1 more. I can say it here. I wonder if I can go back a little.

126
00:32:14,822 --> 00:32:29,842
But I wonder if I can get it. I'm sorry this is purple. Good luck with the 10th volume I did.

127
00:32:29,842 --> 00:32:44,837
It's hard because it's purple. Don't lose. You can do it. I'm standing again right now. Puma.

128
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:59,803
That's right. There is a fire in the middle of the ribbon.

129
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:14,782
Yes I like it.

130
00:33:14,782 --> 00:33:29,804
Mobabis to Masa Date. If you'd like to have it, be careful now so that it won't be crushed.

131
00:33:29,804 --> 00:33:44,795
Mobara. It's not a box. It's here. 10 escape.

132
00:33:44,795 --> 00:33:59,811
You can come here. I don't know if the respawn is over yet. I'm coming later.

133
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:14,811
Shut up. Actually, it was just forehead.

134
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:29,896
Was he alone Octane? I wonder how it was early.

135
00:34:29,896 --> 00:34:44,802
Mobile Tsum. That.

136
00:34:44,802 --> 00:34:59,831
It's transparent. But that's right, I think you remember. Even though it's a Mirage, it's a woman.

137
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:14,828
There is no such season 8. I used it at the Saga tournament. I like it, I want to appear as a gold character.

138
00:35:14,828 --> 00:35:29,830
As Mr. Aru said, when it comes to rank mirage, it doesn't look like Arlandis. It may be good.

139
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:44,793
It's better to go out more, but the new character is also an uncle, isn't it? Hughes Fuse.

140
00:35:44,793 --> 00:35:59,811
Not really. Grenade. Somehow from the name. Only what I tried to do is out.

141
00:35:59,811 --> 00:36:14,815
No details are available. Panic bomb I guess I was firing an arcstar from my right hand from my right hand.

142
00:36:14,815 --> 00:36:44,854
I wonder what it's like. It seems like I'm not sure what a fuse is, isn't it?

143
00:36:44,854 --> 00:37:14,810
Manual winding white here. That is summer vacation.

144
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:29,831
Collect postcards that swing their arms, right, right, right.

145
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:44,805
Aoshi over there. Body 53.

146
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:59,872
There may be a back of blue flames, so it might be better to go back to the center.

147
00:37:59,872 --> 00:38:14,800
Two people can go.

148
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:29,742
I'm sad.

149
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:44,784
Because it was HORIZON that was that. No, I was struck. It was fun. It was fun.

150
00:38:44,784 --> 00:38:59,806
It became. Lifeline I wish it was that. I didn't have it Atsushi If the timing was good.

151
00:38:59,806 --> 00:39:14,827
If you don't wear fight night, you can't wear jeans. Tada. Um, one place like that in Olympus. That seal.

152
00:39:14,827 --> 00:39:29,846
Because it was Hotel Urashima Taro. What is Pathfinder Fight Light? Taro What are you talking about because it was Taro Urashima, money.

153
00:39:29,846 --> 00:39:44,814
It's late. A pathfinder that thinks you are an Olympus.

154
00:39:44,814 --> 00:39:59,799
It won't hit the rain. Actually this guy is pretty good. It happens. Doll grass.

155
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:29,787
Because it's funny, moms. It's to the left.

156
00:40:29,787 --> 00:40:44,808
Geyser. I will go from here.

157
00:40:44,808 --> 00:40:59,831
Let's go with the weapon we found. Mastiff. I haven't found anything. There's only a 3x scope.

158
00:40:59,831 --> 00:41:29,794
EVA 8. Yeah.

159
00:41:29,794 --> 00:41:44,839
I think the center of gravity is probably bent. Even if the trigger is pulled, the ball does not come out and the bolt.

160
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:59,786
I'm done fishing. Do you want a flat line? What is it?

161
00:41:59,786 --> 00:42:14,778
Even if you make a bag. I wonder if it's okay.

162
00:42:14,778 --> 00:42:29,798
me. But I have no choice but to get out. This time.

163
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:44,726
Now that I have a sword.

164
00:42:44,726 --> 00:42:59,797
Maybe I opened the box for my uncertain toothache. this is. It's a hassle, which one.

165
00:42:59,797 --> 00:43:14,855
Then, will Fragment Kawabe go? I have no choice but to go.

166
00:43:14,855 --> 00:43:29,820
Let's enter here and go to the left side. I think it's okay.

167
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:44,829
I hope I can win because I have a house. 8.

168
00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:59,830
I have 12 of them. Wait, I'll go over there now. This is for you.

169
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:14,780
Red snake.

170
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:29,845
I don't notice it. I'm on vacation for the taste. I saw Meieki Live LINE.

171
00:44:29,845 --> 00:44:44,822
I'm a tree.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:45:02,528
I'm dead, maybe my lifeline will remain.

173
00:45:02,528 --> 00:45:17,522
I'm sorry this is broken.

174
00:45:17,522 --> 00:45:32,577
The legendary magnification.

175
00:45:32,577 --> 00:45:47,575
I'm scared. The squirrel will be passed on to future generations. That's right.

176
00:45:47,575 --> 00:46:01,461
OK.

177
00:46:01,461 --> 00:46:17,507
I wonder if it came out.

178
00:46:17,507 --> 00:46:32,523
Shield Someone is this servant. It was true.

179
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:47,547
I wonder if I should bring a lyre. With an update.

180
00:46:47,547 --> 00:47:02,530
Damage is now displayed in combat. There are a lot of people doing it.

181
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:17,517
What should I do? Let's get into the fragment. I'm strong, but I understand. No, it's reliable.

182
00:47:17,517 --> 00:47:32,552
I want to see you all right. It's Fox over there. There is Akasu.

183
00:47:32,552 --> 00:47:47,520
Isn't it still nearby? Please be careful.

184
00:47:47,520 --> 00:48:02,575
There are still. It's full. There is with me. There is no gas. I don't have anything, so I can't.

185
00:48:02,575 --> 00:48:17,535
I have to go later. Let's come to the top of this mountain.

186
00:48:17,535 --> 00:48:32,555
There seems to be no sound. I'm scared so please wake me up. It's a little far away or a feature phone.

187
00:48:32,555 --> 00:48:47,558
So that's it. I'm awake over there.

188
00:48:47,558 --> 00:49:02,583
Yeah, that's scary. The ambiguous par that caused it may have caused it. Anyone far away. When the shield of Ajimu becomes decent in the middle, it becomes decent with Yuka. Until now gag.

189
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:17,574
That's right, it softens. Surplus damage.

190
00:49:17,574 --> 00:49:32,619
Even if it is 1, even if you do 100 damage in the state of 1, it is useless to the body or something like that. It seems that it wasn't just after the start of Season 8.

191
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:47,585
I think it's there. In the Meiji era, armor grows. Update.

192
00:49:47,585 --> 00:50:02,564
Even if you put out the page, it's not so good. It's about 1 o'clock. I want you to be quick.

193
00:50:02,564 --> 00:50:17,557
I love all the broken children, because I love octopus.

194
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:32,563
How many 3 people. The position is.

195
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:47,534
It was made by being hit. I've come to sell a drama house.

196
00:50:47,534 --> 00:51:02,550
Well, there is nothing like that. You can run away at all.

197
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:17,544
It's a little because I said to escape. Here.

198
00:51:17,544 --> 00:51:32,557
Gimpo. Because there are no different enemies in the cave. Is it the same?

199
00:51:32,557 --> 00:51:47,528
I want to go. Another store.

200
00:51:47,528 --> 00:52:02,555
If you can fight the enemy, you're your wife here. You have a wife. But that's it.

201
00:52:02,555 --> 00:52:17,501
It's like shit. Drone.

202
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:32,601
I'm wondering where the stamps are. Ah.

203
00:52:32,601 --> 00:53:02,562
Octane yet. Don't look closely.

204
00:53:02,562 --> 00:53:17,551
What is this?

205
00:53:17,551 --> 00:53:32,544
It's about time for a movie. It swells around here.

206
00:53:32,544 --> 00:53:47,565
Somehow from around here. Even if you are sleeping.

207
00:53:47,565 --> 00:54:02,563
There is one over there. Do you see it? Fight and play. Will also enter.

208
00:54:02,563 --> 00:54:17,554
Ah, I really love snipers. An old woman with a grandmother 1.

209
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:32,560
I think there may be three people.

210
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:47,583
It came down from Tokyo. Who has purple armor as much as a medaka idiot?

211
00:54:47,583 --> 00:55:02,582
Aunt Hiho Bangalore Soichi looks okay. Not here.

212
00:55:02,582 --> 00:55:17,565
I ate it. I wonder if it has recovered.

213
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:32,605
I want you. Yes ban was 90 now. There are 33 people over there. Shield 7.

214
00:55:32,605 --> 00:55:47,589
Where. About 4 more. Then it may be better to be careful because it is in the middle even a little here.

215
00:55:47,589 --> 00:56:02,577
I feel like going, but I'm here. That is also a theater. Meat bun chilled mark is me.

216
00:56:02,577 --> 00:56:17,566
I wonder if it will come closer.

217
00:56:17,566 --> 00:56:32,538
Please listen. What is the stage for dad?

218
00:56:32,538 --> 00:57:02,526
Everyone is okay, recovery is okay. Battery version.

219
00:57:02,526 --> 00:57:17,538
I'm inside for the time being.

220
00:57:17,538 --> 00:57:32,569
Give it a try. But kun, I'm going a lot, octopus and what's this? I was scared when I opened it, so I opened it.

221
00:57:32,569 --> 00:58:02,534
If my mother is deceived, nothing will happen. Maybe it's because I was upset.

222
00:58:02,534 --> 00:58:32,583
You've accumulated, haven't you fallen? Nice nice Be careful from this email.

223
00:58:32,583 --> 00:58:47,569
Maybe they're just playing one. Oh no, because there's a zipline, you can go to it. 13 stations.

224
00:58:47,569 --> 00:59:02,557
Would you like to let a man do it here? Maybe you should go. Do you want to go to the insurance company?

225
00:59:02,557 --> 00:59:17,593
Be careful with gas Yes. From the soba noodles.

226
00:59:17,593 --> 00:59:32,576
That's right, now that it's down, there are a lot of purple here. I think it is. It looks like.

227
00:59:32,576 --> 00:59:47,547
Now. It's coming from the back. Clean it from now on.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,399
I'm not stupid because there are people with myopia. I'm not stupid.

229
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:18,425
It was banned by all means. I did this star. It was.

230
01:00:18,425 --> 01:00:33,444
I managed to do it. I escaped. It was good theme song.

231
01:00:33,444 --> 01:00:48,400
The 1200th generation is good. Isn't it the worst? I'm not awake.

232
01:00:48,400 --> 01:01:03,438
I remember when I had 3 units left. Old man.

233
01:01:03,438 --> 01:01:18,427
It's a good game. Battle pass.

234
01:01:18,427 --> 01:01:33,441
The page changed, but it's already 7 o'clock. I wonder if it changes every half of the squid. It's noisy.

235
01:01:33,441 --> 01:01:48,409
yrs. Is it loose with UR?

236
01:01:48,409 --> 01:02:03,407
I'm depressed from urs in. I made a mistake because there was a change.

237
01:02:03,407 --> 01:02:33,368
I'm a cannon. In Tokyo. 12.

238
01:02:33,368 --> 01:02:48,461
I didn't write any jeans here.

239
01:02:48,461 --> 01:03:03,444
Quite OK. Is it like this?

240
01:03:03,444 --> 01:03:19,506
But maybe they won't come, night night.

241
01:03:19,506 --> 01:03:33,421
The reason I woke up was up to high school students.

242
01:03:33,421 --> 01:03:48,449
0 years old 6 years old.

243
01:03:48,449 --> 01:04:03,463
I might try to wake it up now. It's a megara. This bastard makes a kitakitakita niche.

244
01:04:03,463 --> 01:04:18,434
I'm busy right now. now.

245
01:04:18,434 --> 01:04:33,455
I wonder if my face came in from the wall. This is Fight Knight.

246
01:04:33,455 --> 01:04:48,452
There aren't many people coming, isn't it? It's a miracle below. If you have a weapon.

247
01:04:48,452 --> 01:05:03,444
Takahata Holy Holy. The current fictitious thing was really interesting.

248
01:05:03,444 --> 01:05:18,450
Of Mirage. That's a hologram. It looks like he had a great face.

249
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:33,453
What is it. Face from the wall. Olympus After all. Punch and Solare are popular spots.

250
01:05:33,453 --> 01:05:48,441
Solare is where the rug was down. There is. Asao Ward Lifeline I wonder if I'm using it quite a bit.

251
01:05:48,441 --> 01:06:03,459
I also want a hammer Why is it a lifeline? I don't want to recover Honestly, I've been a healer in various online games.

252
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:18,493
Villa Hoax Not good while holding the lives of others.

253
01:06:18,493 --> 01:06:33,403
Begging for your life, live or die. I'm here.

254
01:06:33,403 --> 01:06:48,399
With an alternator.

255
01:06:48,399 --> 01:07:03,413
Accelerator. OK.

256
01:07:03,413 --> 01:07:18,373
Of the cornea.

257
01:07:18,373 --> 01:07:33,426
It's also in the sea, because you can use it habitually. I'm hungry after being struck. I understand. I'll cook rice.

258
01:07:33,426 --> 01:07:48,429
But I want to eat it.

259
01:07:48,429 --> 01:08:03,432
I'm waiting for the stir-fried vegetables. The sound is going. Attack, attack, attack.

260
01:08:03,432 --> 01:08:18,404
I'm stupid. Delicious one.

261
01:08:18,404 --> 01:08:33,403
It's over. Great Satan.

262
01:08:33,403 --> 01:08:48,448
Do nothing. Tenmak.

263
01:08:48,448 --> 01:09:03,421
I got this festival as a memorial. I will go back once.

264
01:09:03,421 --> 01:09:33,418
It's fun to say that. But I'm that.

265
01:09:33,418 --> 01:09:48,458
It's a matter of tension. Even if you take me and lose.

266
01:09:48,458 --> 01:10:03,442
Taiyaki Pass Paris, just one more shot. That's not true.

267
01:10:03,442 --> 01:10:18,453
It's totally different. Have a solar light.

268
01:10:18,453 --> 01:10:33,416
Let's go to the estate. Come here at HORIZON. son.

269
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:48,410
I've never seen it. The story of Avex, which was this house.

270
01:10:48,410 --> 01:11:03,414
Something like that HORIZON event. Not much, but is there something? It was about 230 years ago. The ruins are there, but they look expensive, but they are amazing.

271
01:11:03,414 --> 01:11:18,381
Raise the level. I'm strong.

272
01:11:18,381 --> 01:11:33,420
I want to make a tea pack, but I can't send it. Don't be careful with the other party OK.

273
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:48,445
It's my last name. Choregi dressing taste.

274
01:11:48,445 --> 01:12:03,454
Stir-fried plum and chicken. Oh yeah, if you fry it lightly, it's sweet.

275
01:12:03,454 --> 01:12:18,422
The back mirage with some strange motion now.

276
01:12:18,422 --> 01:12:33,492
Sometimes I make weapons, but it disappears. What should I say that? That gold trophy, the one who hits me, I wonder if it's okay to point to that.

277
01:12:33,492 --> 01:12:48,434
There's a guy I want to see. That's a mess that's so rare that it comes out once in a million times.

278
01:12:48,434 --> 01:13:03,468
Certainly I saw it for the first time. It's common, isn't it? The phone that comes out once every 1000 times. Kana Ueda. I'm definitely killing Marby.

279
01:13:03,468 --> 01:13:18,418
It's close.

280
01:13:18,418 --> 01:13:33,449
I definitely have to move them too. Did this happen? You can cut the lane here.

281
01:13:33,449 --> 01:13:48,408
I dropped the 712 that was there.

282
01:13:48,408 --> 01:14:18,436
I'm left behind Is it okay? It's far away. I'm being beaten.

283
01:14:18,436 --> 01:14:33,424
It's really bad, it's really good. I want to go to Good, good, good.

284
01:14:33,424 --> 01:14:48,421
3 pies or 3 pies. I'm fighting over here.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 01:15:05,405
Also, because it's outside the area, I lived a little deeper, right? Estate Home Bamboo This.

286
01:15:05,405 --> 01:15:20,397
Ueno, Futatsuimachi.

287
01:15:20,397 --> 01:15:35,424
Wherever you are, you're probably targeted, but you're in a mess of lanes.

288
01:15:35,424 --> 01:15:50,461
Another unit I am.

289
01:15:50,461 --> 01:16:05,394
But I'm there too.

290
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:20,433
It's OK that I went inside thinking that a small friend would help me. Be careful because you said something.

291
01:16:20,433 --> 01:16:35,421
Do you want a turbine even when the tank is full?

292
01:16:35,421 --> 01:16:50,435
It was Toyonaka. You're drunk in this car. Thank you for that.

293
01:16:50,435 --> 01:17:05,429
This is driving. Wait a minute, drive for the first time, for the first time.

294
01:17:05,429 --> 01:17:20,420
No no. Tokyo patent license.

295
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:35,414
Today today today today. It's OK to deepen it.

296
01:17:35,414 --> 01:17:50,438
It was dangerous.

297
01:17:50,438 --> 01:18:05,429
Pastel-kun, if you're fine. Call me Itako.

298
01:18:05,429 --> 01:18:20,416
Nasca shield. Miyabi-kun. That tea backpacker mine.

299
01:18:20,416 --> 01:18:35,400
I don't have the right. I want you to wait for a monkey over there.

300
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:50,382
It was pretty fast. Well, it's us.

301
01:18:50,382 --> 01:19:05,420
K-ON.

302
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:20,388
There is a taxi, Hemlock. P 20.

303
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:35,415
