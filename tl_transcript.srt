1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:48,405
Everyone who gathers today.

2
00:01:48,405 --> 00:02:03,372
I was caught on a naughty Sam 2.

3
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:18,358
It's a senior who has seen me. Number of subscribers 939144.

4
00:02:18,358 --> 00:02:33,379
Stop by here.

5
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:48,347
Everything to stay.

6
00:02:48,347 --> 00:03:03,359
The power of eroticism is strong.

7
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:18,376
I'm worried about even a little quieter sound.

8
00:03:18,376 --> 00:03:48,420
I have to find the number from Diana's site before I choose the number. It's like being banned by YouTube, which isn't inside.

9
00:03:48,420 --> 00:04:03,402
Since this is what, the number is selected from the comments, so it is not necessarily a picture.

10
00:04:03,402 --> 00:04:18,372
This is a site where you can sleep because you don't. I repeat.

11
00:04:18,372 --> 00:04:33,404
The first is to exceed 150,000 people. Do I have to repeat it?

12
00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:48,376
I got spoiled today, everyone hasn't seen it, hasn't seen it, hasn't seen the darkness.

13
00:04:48,376 --> 00:05:03,368
By 24:00.

14
00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:18,390
Punishment game If you do not break through while playing the dialogue, there is a punishment game that will be a monkey. It's already gone.

15
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:33,350
Today, in that boxing, it's like a sandbag parent and child. So I.

16
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:48,380
Not just the 95th volume.

17
00:05:48,380 --> 00:06:03,360
I'm not doing it because I want to do it. It's an etch with.

18
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:48,367
950,000 flights by 4 o'clock.

19
00:06:48,367 --> 00:07:18,373
I'm thinking of doing it daddy, but that's right, because I'm approaching 950,000 people.

20
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:33,370
2990. That's bad.

21
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:48,424
No matter what you think. It's not the turn, this is the one who does it alone.

22
00:07:48,424 --> 00:08:03,371
I would like to go to Masato. Find out and explain something.

23
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:18,369
I didn't see it in my eyes, but it's hell. Would you like to go in Nakata?

24
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:33,384
Let's choose a number from 1 to 2999.

25
00:08:33,384 --> 00:08:48,389
From when to 2999, you can choose any number you like. I always do that. It's like a terrible middle-aged illness right now.

26
00:08:48,389 --> 00:09:03,375
I'm saying it might be okay.

27
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:18,355
It's not unusual to come suddenly.

28
00:09:18,355 --> 00:09:33,394
2000 I will choose from here.

29
00:09:33,394 --> 00:10:03,339
Minatoya who can play nearby. What is this?

30
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:48,382
I could have gone anywhere next time on my tablet, but the rug looks good on me, so I could make a mistake, so I'm lucky. Thank you.

31
00:10:48,382 --> 00:11:03,375
This is like a sermon. If you are a positive idiot, there is still a possibility, but it is backward.

32
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:18,360
Tamagawa When I made a fool of myself, I found a dry food bag.

33
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:33,328
Let's enter with such a thing.

34
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:48,378
This is not real. 1110110.

35
00:11:48,378 --> 00:12:18,289
Really.

36
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:33,393
It 's really serious even if you pay for it.

37
00:12:33,393 --> 00:12:48,287
sorry.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:13:28,401
I can't help it.

39
00:13:28,401 --> 00:13:43,400
Seriously. Don't say this or this. It's still serious, really.

40
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:58,394
It was used as if it was on the go. I was told that lolicon and ciscon are different.

41
00:13:58,394 --> 00:14:13,405
I can't do it anymore.

42
00:14:13,405 --> 00:14:28,319
This is this.

43
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:43,396
It's just hell.

44
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:58,393
It doesn't stop. How many subscribers are there now?

45
00:14:58,393 --> 00:15:28,359
Already. Already around here.

46
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:43,398
I don't even know, maybe I'll keep doing this for another two and a half hours.

47
00:15:43,398 --> 00:15:58,452
But in the last 30 minutes and 10 minutes. Packaging like this near. Thank you.

48
00:15:58,452 --> 00:16:13,406
But 300 seniors who have subscribed to the channel now. It's said that 940,000 people have experienced it, but it's different.

49
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:28,410
Thank you for stopping the channel.

50
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:43,400
I don't have time to skip.

51
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:58,357
What the hell are 2909 and 2900.

52
00:16:58,357 --> 00:17:28,403
Some people have 3 hours left, but it's not a designated time. This is that guy. Chris Ryu Shimizu-cho There was something like that.

53
00:17:28,403 --> 00:17:43,396
Is this?

54
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:58,356
909. This is what technique 2900.

55
00:17:58,356 --> 00:18:13,395
16 Ai-chan.

56
00:18:13,395 --> 00:18:28,420
I don't know what it is because it's okay today.

57
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:43,410
It's autumn already.

58
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:58,420
Put it on the blacklist.

59
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:28,421
Who is it?

60
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:43,417
Today's highlights.

61
00:19:43,417 --> 00:20:13,383
Because it's beating.

62
00:20:13,383 --> 00:20:28,372
Mind weather Mind preparation.

63
00:20:13,383 --> 00:20:43,377
It's not a deadly line, isn't it?

64
00:20:28,372 --> 00:21:13,402
Have been seen.

65
00:21:13,402 --> 00:22:13,405
You don't have to put it on. I'm dead.

66
00:22:13,405 --> 00:22:28,347
What is your mother's idol life?

67
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:43,351
Buta Yarou. Called Izumo.

68
00:22:43,351 --> 00:22:58,369
Idol. Redeem 950,000 subscribers. Idol.

69
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:13,314
finished.

70
00:23:13,314 --> 00:23:28,383
It helps.

71
00:23:28,383 --> 00:23:43,337
It hasn't started yet.

72
00:23:43,337 --> 00:23:58,443
The first idol life is over. It will start again. I would like to choose the next number.

73
00:23:58,443 --> 00:24:13,421
I wonder what was saved Yoshida Next, I think I chose that.

74
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:28,360
Knowingly.

75
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:43,400
Shiori-san.

76
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:58,387
What I went to while I was doing I hadn't done it yet. 330.

77
00:24:58,387 --> 00:25:13,385
336.

78
00:25:13,385 --> 00:25:28,379
Really no. This is really only black history.

79
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:58,392
I can't really say anything.

80
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:28,412
Even if it is. Even in your heart.

81
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:43,396
It's definitely embarrassing.

82
00:26:43,396 --> 00:26:58,440
I'm tired of such efforts. I got a kiss shot that was 36, but I was hurt.

83
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:13,393
Wasted effort now.

84
00:27:13,393 --> 00:27:28,400
I really don't know what I'm saying next.

85
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:43,390
It's on sale. I'm taking a bath.

86
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:58,415
If you quarrel only with the disadvantages that you can make up with this, you will be naked. Why were you crying from above?

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:28:15,257
Apologize early Yes, apologize.

88
00:28:15,257 --> 00:28:45,272
High and what is a good qualification. Senior. Naughty cell Read a little.

89
00:28:45,272 --> 00:29:00,253
It's just the last minute.

90
00:29:00,253 --> 00:29:15,256
It is unavoidable fiercely. Red heart.

91
00:29:15,256 --> 00:29:30,211
Red heart.

92
00:29:30,211 --> 00:29:45,304
Last-minute battle.

93
00:29:45,304 --> 00:30:00,277
But not.

94
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:15,280
It's not English. It's not English.

95
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:45,272
Hell tour.

96
00:30:45,272 --> 00:31:15,267
That's bad. Thank you for your cooperation.

97
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:45,292
Thank you. No. 902.

98
00:31:45,292 --> 00:32:00,288
I forgot whether it was 920 or 902.

99
00:32:00,288 --> 00:32:45,318
This should be done with a man's voice.

100
00:32:45,318 --> 00:33:15,279
I wonder if this is getting up.

101
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:30,288
Very much. I was told I like it.

102
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:45,275
Mega. TERA I woke up.

103
00:33:45,275 --> 00:34:15,231
before that.

104
00:34:15,231 --> 00:35:00,326
Thank you very much. Subscribe to the channel and you'll be listening to the September lines of the prefecture. Don't look at it with empathy shame. Subscribe to the channel early.

105
00:35:00,326 --> 00:35:15,283
Thank you really. Empathic shame. Please finish it yet.

106
00:35:15,283 --> 00:35:30,262
Anything is fine, but I still want to do this today.

107
00:35:30,262 --> 00:36:00,289
I will choose this. Thank you for your comment.

108
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:15,294
Just do it.

109
00:36:15,294 --> 00:36:30,320
Thank you. Come on, wake me up with my friends, what's going on with my mom now?

110
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:45,297
Friends who are unlikely to subscribe to the channel. I'm in trouble with my mom.

111
00:36:45,297 --> 00:37:00,289
1921.

112
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:15,272
It seems that you have registered 2 channels. What this child. That dangerous festival.

113
00:37:15,272 --> 00:37:30,299
No. 1921.

114
00:37:30,299 --> 00:37:45,305
TSUTAYA's self is still better.

115
00:37:45,305 --> 00:38:15,347
I would like to read this book with my own eyes in commemoration of Hinata. Who is the enemy? Who is the enemy?

116
00:38:15,347 --> 00:38:30,307
Hell or Tokushima After a while, who is the enemy and what?

117
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:45,275
Yu-chan is okay. It doesn't matter which one.

118
00:38:45,275 --> 00:39:00,296
In Karamatsu, the heart is the character.

119
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:15,295
Well that's what it is.

120
00:39:15,295 --> 00:39:45,288
Today's. At 24:00.

121
00:39:45,288 --> 00:40:00,298
Which one ends up with garbage? Pass case.

122
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:15,319
Hololive Life is over. Not only that idol life but also the Hololive life is over.

123
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:30,304
Hachama. The idol teacher is over, and even 5 people are over.

124
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:45,339
I always hit him in boxing, using a punching bag as a yago. I just hit him.

125
00:40:45,339 --> 00:41:00,292
Preserving tomatoes Only the seniors who are watching are real allies.

126
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:15,270
I know. I know I love you all the time.

127
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:30,266
This metamorphosis.

128
00:41:30,266 --> 00:41:45,232
let's go.

129
00:41:45,232 --> 00:42:00,290
This is a metamorphosis. It wasn't today.

130
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:15,292
186.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:43:17,150
YouTube massage.

132
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:32,101
I haven't said it yet.

133
00:43:32,101 --> 00:45:17,164
Shizuka-chan's birthday.

134
00:45:17,164 --> 00:45:32,116
What's in it?

135
00:45:32,116 --> 00:45:47,172
6-chan is shy.

136
00:45:47,172 --> 00:46:02,146
The timing is not too good.

137
00:46:02,146 --> 00:46:17,115
I'm not ready for my heart yet.

138
00:46:17,115 --> 00:47:02,118
Then I will go.

139
00:47:02,118 --> 00:47:32,068
Ten.

140
00:47:32,068 --> 00:48:02,183
I'm going to 3 o'clock after this.

141
00:48:02,183 --> 00:48:17,169
I wonder if it will melt and be cut out. Everyone.

142
00:48:17,169 --> 00:48:32,090
If so.

143
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:47,142
I'll do my best not to hit the erotic TV. It doesn't hit the erotic lines.

144
00:48:47,142 --> 00:49:02,105
Good for February. I want to do the lines Hartman. Do you get it.

145
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:17,165
It doesn't have to be noon.

146
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:32,074
I'm going.

147
00:49:32,074 --> 00:50:02,144
I'll make it a little bad.

148
00:50:02,144 --> 00:50:17,135
But it was good.

149
00:50:17,135 --> 00:50:32,139
Is there such a thing in a serious game? Wrestling.

150
00:50:32,139 --> 00:50:47,167
It wasn't normal.

151
00:50:47,167 --> 00:51:02,193
It was a sentence called "Crispy" in this area, OK.

152
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:17,182
2000. OK.

153
00:51:17,182 --> 00:51:32,123
This is that kind of thing.

154
00:51:32,123 --> 00:51:47,136
The character in the gap from the bottom.

155
00:51:47,136 --> 00:52:02,169
I was interested in such a big heart. I think I'm thinking like this.

156
00:52:02,169 --> 00:52:17,148
It's rather embarrassing.

157
00:52:17,148 --> 00:52:32,141
Yanagicho, Suzuka City.

158
00:52:32,141 --> 00:52:47,164
If you make a fool of such a celebrity gag in the future, 3 will be made together. It seems to be misunderstood that it is on fire.

159
00:52:47,164 --> 00:53:17,148
I see, Ami over here. It's not that it's okay, read it over here.

160
00:53:17,148 --> 00:53:47,158
Two earths.

161
00:53:47,158 --> 00:54:17,169
You say you didn't call Siri.

162
00:54:17,169 --> 00:54:32,183
Half a month now it sounds like a meaning. This Japan is too rich and too rich.

163
00:54:32,183 --> 00:54:47,202
I'm tired of Hitachi. Legislation Why is it ridiculous now?

164
00:54:47,202 --> 00:55:02,106
2650.

165
00:55:02,106 --> 00:55:17,173
655. This number is 2655. It's like 2650 yen, isn't it?

166
00:55:17,173 --> 00:55:32,116
Egging like this. Draw like this.

167
00:55:32,116 --> 00:55:47,138
This is the only one that has been decided completely.

168
00:55:47,138 --> 00:56:02,153
Song this.

169
00:56:02,153 --> 00:57:17,114
When you calculate.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:58:34,031
From 4 pm.

171
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:49,000
Yeah birthday.

172
00:58:49,000 --> 00:59:04,034
This is long.

173
00:59:04,034 --> 00:59:19,994
It 's because of this child, it 's really long. I'm here.

174
00:59:19,994 --> 00:59:34,062
Face feeling. There may be a reaction that you haven't eaten.

175
00:59:34,062 --> 00:59:49,069
What kind of project is it so you have to read it?

176
00:59:49,069 --> 01:00:19,068
I'm nervous.

177
01:00:19,068 --> 01:00:34,995
It's such a long time.

178
01:00:34,995 --> 01:00:49,028
I thought it was a Basque foot massage. Yeah.

179
01:00:49,028 --> 01:01:04,077
Shame Shame has come down.

180
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:34,003
It was a little self-weighted, but it seems to be dangerous, so I made a note on the way.

181
01:01:34,003 --> 01:01:49,028
koekoe.

182
01:01:49,028 --> 01:02:19,035
It was a little long, wasn't it?

183
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:34,964
It's totally fine.

184
01:02:34,964 --> 01:02:49,059
Acer.

185
01:02:49,059 --> 01:03:04,031

Kuwako collaborated over and over again What a collaboration. Battle collection 0275.002.27.

188
01:03:34,033 --> 01:03:49,034
It wasn't fragile a while ago.

189
01:03:49,034 --> 01:04:04,009
This is strange.

190
01:04:04,009 --> 01:05:04,078
Video.

191
01:05:04,078 --> 01:05:19,100
I'll do another 2 hours at this time. Why did you shut up and why did you come out?

192
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:34,036
It 's over. I want to see the finale.

193
01:05:34,036 --> 01:06:04,035
Somehow. That's why.

194
01:06:04,035 --> 01:06:19,040
Still more 3.

01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:34,028

Wait for the highest ever. Really. Really bad.

197
01:07:04,027 --> 01:07:19,029
I think I can go with this BGM.

198
01:07:19,029 --> 01:07:49,971
Harder.

199
01:07:49,971 --> 01:08:19,964
This is terrible.

200
01:08:19,964 --> 01:08:49,033
My husband.

201
01:08:49,033 --> 01:09:04,035
I'm already enrolled.

202
01:09:04,035 --> 01:09:19,042
It may not be there, it really doesn't help. Stop this atmosphere.

203
01:09:19,042 --> 01:09:34,032
There is no money in the archive.

204
01:09:34,032 --> 01:09:49,045
It remains, but where is it?

205
01:09:49,045 --> 01:10:04,016
I don't think I'll leave it Where I want to leave it, but where. You can't leave it.

206
01:10:04,016 --> 01:10:19,006
I haven't made a slight movement.

01:11:04,016 --> 01:11:19,005
It was a stew toy. Is it Chuunibyo?

211

People and cockroaches change the environment, change the stars, and even change their appearance. If there is a miscalculation.

213
01:11:49,038 --> 01:12:04,000
What does it mean. What are you saying?

214
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:19,050

01:13:36,052 --> 01:13:51,068
Then do you really have one?

220
01:13:51,068 --> 01:14:06,099
There are stones on the sofa, so I don't know. This project is a hellish delivery. I'm doing it.

221
01:14:06,099 --> 01:14:21,059
Even reckless. 950,000 people.

222
01:14:21,059 --> 01:14:36,094
I'm betting on a little possibility and I'm delivering it now.

223
01:14:36,094 --> 01:14:51,068
No matter how embarrassing it is. Even if the character sometimes collapses.

224
01:14:51,068 --> 01:15:06,015
I'll do my best. next.

225
01:15:06,015 --> 01:15:21,086

Of 400 people.

228
01:15:51,060 --> 01:16:21,017
It's OK.

229
01:16:21,017 --> 01:16:51,074
This is not so much because there is a suitable chan.

230
01:16:51,074 --> 01:17:06,074
I often hit this.

231
01:17:06,074 --> 01:17:21,074
Yes let's go.

232
01:17:21,074 --> 01:17:36,114

01:18:21,068 --> 01:18:36,042
No. 175.

237
01:18:36,042 --> 01:18:51,039
On a full moon night.

238
01:18:51,039 --> 01:19:06,073
I called it suddenly.

239
01:19:06,073 --> 01:19:21,060
I've been thinking about flowers for a long time. I'm sorry to be late.

240
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:36,082
Hatamoto-senpai has a relationship with other people. I don't want to think about it.

241
01:19:36,082 --> 01:20:06,098
For a long time.

242
01:20:06,098 --> 01:20:21,123
I lived. I don't know. I have to propose to my mom to get married.

243
01:20:21,123 --> 01:20:36,077
It's the role of seniors. I'm divorced. Divorce.

244
01:20:36,077 --> 01:20:51,105
Please do 95 from there. What would it be like to get married in-house? Speed ​​marriage.

245
01:20:51,105 --> 01:21:36,070
It's embarrassing if it's that rear, so it's a little crap with abandoned dirt.

246
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:51,085
Hartman no matter what comes.

247
01:21:51,085 --> 01:22:06,089
Well, is it a calculation or a calculation?

248
01:22:06,089 --> 01:22:21,057
Both those who are doing and those who are listening are embarrassing lines. That's right.

249
01:22:21,057 --> 01:22:36,077
I'm sweating but you can hug me.

250
01:22:36,077 --> 01:22:51,102
I'll do both. Either way. Boy version to that 2.

251
01:22:51,102 --> 01:23:06,081
I want to hug you. I'm sweating.

252
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:21,092
Keyboard version. I'm in love.

253
01:23:21,092 --> 01:23:51,031
It feels bad.

254
01:23:51,031 --> 01:24:06,104
Please accept even such an unpleasant vomiting.

255
01:24:06,104 --> 01:24:21,124
I may have gotten sick. It's OK. Let's go next. I can't see the registered one.

256
01:24:21,124 --> 01:24:36,049
Unless it's bad in the latter half of 2987.5.

257
01:24:36,049 --> 01:24:51,090
It's hard to say that it's dangerous. Heart. The address ends early, 729829.

258
01:24:51,090 --> 01:25:06,004
It was fun.

259
01:25:06,004 --> 01:26:36,035
Somehow, a perverted imagination. What kind of operation did you do?

260
01:26:36,035 --> 01:26:51,098
I'm not embarrassed, so I'll go without BGM anymore.

261
01:26:51,098 --> 01:27:06,065
Perfect.

262
01:27:06,065 --> 01:27:21,107
I'm imagining this though it's erotic. What did you imagine? It's erotic now.

263
01:27:21,107 --> 01:27:36,041
Yes what do you use it for?

264
01:27:36,041 --> 01:27:51,130
That's why it was called metamorphosis. The only thing that can't be helped is that all humankind is not a metamorphosis.

265
01:27:51,130 --> 01:28:06,096
It's okay to be told that you have an appetite.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 01:28:53,076
I can't coat it at all.

267
01:28:53,076 --> 01:29:08,079
I'm a senior who has been working with the 1700 since a while ago, but the name is 1700, which is so bad. A little.

268
01:29:08,079 --> 01:29:38,051
I want you to see it. 56. What do you mean?

269
01:29:38,051 --> 01:29:53,026
Something is completed by throwing.

270
01:29:53,026 --> 01:30:08,046
I'm wondering if it will get infected, but let's check it for a moment. From 2708. You've hit this site anyway.

271
01:30:08,046 --> 01:30:23,060

2250 in total from here.

274
01:30:53,061 --> 01:31:08,015
There is such a line 56. I sometimes hand it over to such a simple thing.

275
01:31:08,015 --> 01:31:38,049
There's a connection, this is such a short sentence. This was selected.

276
01:31:38,049 --> 01:32:08,018
Animals are dirty. Thank you.

277
01:32:08,018 --> 01:32:23,047
AV is.

278
01:32:23,047 --> 01:32:38,072
The flowers that seem to last until 24:00.

279
01:32:38,072 --> 01:33:23,077
I wonder why there is no reason to pierce this thread. It's just stepped on.

280
01:33:23,077 --> 01:33:38,990
let's go.

281
01:33:38,990 --> 01:33:53,035

284
01:34:23,056 --> 01:34:53,097
I didn't know the original story Hartman doesn't know at all. I'm sorry to be there.

285
01:34:53,097 --> 01:35:23,045
Only those who are prepared to be shot.

286
01:35:23,045 --> 01:35:38,978
Stop.

287
01:35:38,978 --> 01:35:53,068
No, it's too late and nothing has come.

288
01:35:53,068 --> 01:36:08,053
Ah, I'm glad that this is the plan. Somehow, only everyone, Love-chan, came up and the hurdle was raised by consultation.

289
01:36:08,053 --> 01:36:23,039
I'm really glad that this lowered the hurdle.

290
01:36:23,039 --> 01:38:23,071
800 can go, this is one more. Station 1939.

printer.

296
01:40:08,981 --> 01:40:53,096
From now on, the number 7 is so bad. Absolutely not dangerous.

297
01:40:53,096 --> 01:41:08,977
What is this?

298
01:41:08,977 --> 01:41:53,987
I know.

299
01:41:53,987 --> 01:42:08,151
But it's different. Everyone isn't asking for it.

300
01:42:08,151 --> 01:42:38,036
YouTube.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 01:52:25,980

308
01:54:10,951 --> 01:54:25,943
Tarumi's naughty. It's a metamorphosis here.

01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:25,982

317
01:56:25,982 --> 01:56:40,913
281. I'm worried.

337
02:07:12,838 --> 02:07:27,841
I would like to choose.

338
02:07:27,841 --> 02:07:42,839
I don't have time to do it properly. Hey.

339
02:07:42,839 --> 02:07:57,874
From 2981 to 2987.

340
02:07:57,874 --> 02:08:12,887
I think I can understand it. 81. I'm thinking.

341
02:08:12,887 --> 02:08:27,884
I'm looking at the heavens. It would be embarrassing if I couldn't understand Ha-chan using the Pokemon combination technique.

342
02:08:27,884 --> 02:08:57,877
I see, that's 2987.

343
02:08:57,877 --> 02:09:42,847
It's impossible like this.

344
02:09:42,847 --> 02:09:57,858
It's like this. Oh yeah that was number two.

345
02:09:57,858 --> 02:10:12,831
Remember you.

346
02:10:12,831 --> 02:10:27,869
It's a baccarat table or a fool, but really.

347
02:10:27,869 --> 02:10:42,912
My legs are paralyzed.

348
02:10:42,912 --> 02:10:57,851
This is what BGM does. Being killed by an evil organization.

349
02:10:57,851 --> 02:11:12,887
It's easier to do in 59 days.

350
02:11:12,887 --> 02:12:12,884
I don't cry.

351
02:12:12,884 --> 02:13:12,839
Task Nakayama Idiot. Precure.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 02:14:14,802
This is true.

353
02:14:14,802 --> 02:14:29,797
It's a powerful bullying.

354
02:14:29,797 --> 02:15:44,832
To put it better, fall down. I can't do it again.

355
02:15:44,832 --> 02:15:59,823
When will you come back? It's fun today.

356
02:15:59,823 --> 02:16:14,855
I wonder if there is a line of the application. Will Otomo change?

357
02:16:14,855 --> 02:16:59,835
I haven't said it yet.

358
02:16:59,835 --> 02:17:14,835
1912.

359
02:17:14,835 --> 02:17:29,836
Why did you come here often? I can't drink black coffee.

360
02:17:29,836 --> 02:17:44,816
Because it's the last spurt.

361
02:17:44,816 --> 02:17:59,862
I'm glad I was able to lower the hurdle and hurdle now. It was really good. 2961.

362
02:17:59,862 --> 02:18:44,842
It's painful. Video of boobs. English.

363
02:18:44,842 --> 02:18:59,808
It was 2002. Grandma is coming.

364
02:18:59,808 --> 02:19:14,823
The moon of the Dark Demon King. Of 100,000 billion soil.

365
02:19:14,823 --> 02:19:29,847
Judge in the darkness and send to hell.

366
02:19:29,847 --> 02:19:44,824
Anyway.

367
02:19:44,824 --> 02:19:59,836
The messenger of the dark soil.

368
02:19:59,836 --> 02:20:14,825
I'm saying I want to be in the pool. Hurt at home.

369
02:20:14,825 --> 02:20:29,826
It's almost over.

370
02:20:29,826 --> 02:20:44,764
4 hours.

371
02:20:44,764 --> 02:20:59,785
this.

372
02:20:59,785 --> 02:21:14,825
2968 from 2967. 2967.

373
02:21:14,825 --> 02:21:44,779
I do not go.

374
02:21:44,779 --> 02:22:14,860
I was worried about Ghibli.

375
02:22:14,860 --> 02:22:29,822
Cockroaches shouldn't be too cute.

376
02:22:29,822 --> 02:22:44,879
It 's powerful. Who are you kissing?

377
02:22:44,879 --> 02:23:14,837
Matching technique. 2715.

378
02:23:14,837 --> 02:23:29,818
2900.

379
02:23:29,818 --> 02:24:29,816
I made it look simple.

380
02:24:29,816 --> 02:24:44,876
Simple mistake. I simply made a mistake.

381
02:24:44,876 --> 02:25:29,832
Box tissue Takeda.

382
02:25:29,832 --> 02:25:44,851
I don't need anything else. It's already separated.

383
02:25:44,851 --> 02:26:14,765
Happily.

384
02:26:14,765 --> 02:26:29,818
Let's go steadily.

385
02:26:29,818 --> 02:26:44,839
Abuse I should sleep, but it's not easy to come out. So that's it.

386
02:26:44,839 --> 02:26:59,801
13434.

387
02:26:59,801 --> 02:27:14,820
It's the road line of the road.

388
02:27:14,820 --> 02:27:44,827
Marumaru every time. It became a nearby one. It was 4 I simply forgot.

389
02:27:44,827 --> 02:28:14,752
Senior.

390
00:00:00,000 --> 02:28:46,041
I don't feel any shame, Ma-chan. I caught a cold. Yocchi-kun.

391
02:28:46,041 --> 02:29:01,977
Is that so?

392
02:29:01,977 --> 02:30:01,957
I can't stand it.

393
02:30:01,957 --> 02:30:16,946
Let me know.

394
02:30:16,946 --> 02:30:46,996
I can't see the comment. Yes while looking at the comments.

395
02:30:46,996 --> 02:31:01,969
Kotaro the dog.

396
02:31:01,969 --> 02:31:16,902
It 's dangerous.

397
02:31:16,902 --> 02:31:46,975
23 minutes left.

398
02:31:46,975 --> 02:32:01,984
I'm watching for $ 1. I'm worried about this.

399
02:32:01,984 --> 02:32:16,978
Let's go. What is this?

400
02:32:16,978 --> 02:32:31,001
There were 10 from 0750, and the collaboration is back.

401
02:32:31,001 --> 02:32:46,000
750. There was such a thing.

402
02:32:46,000 --> 02:33:01,071
You probably collaborated by seeing Mr. Osomatsu's guy.

403
02:33:01,071 --> 02:33:46,988
No matter what you think about going.

404
02:33:46,988 --> 02:34:16,990
With that kind of eyes. I have to wear pants.

405
02:34:16,990 --> 02:34:31,978
Why this situation.

406
02:34:31,978 --> 02:35:01,978
Sometimes sometimes.

407
02:35:01,978 --> 02:35:16,048
It's still a combination.

408
02:35:16,048 --> 02:35:31,898
07.

409
02:35:31,898 --> 02:35:46,007
Color 1593 is pure.

410
02:35:46,007 --> 02:38:46,994
Piano Fortissimo.

411
02:38:46,994 --> 02:39:31,991
What can be said clearly. The red box peeed on the steam iron.

412
02:39:31,991 --> 02:39:46,000
It's fashionable, I just watched it licking.

413
02:39:46,000 --> 02:40:31,982
Bike Rider. Next line.

414
02:40:31,982 --> 02:40:46,035
If you can. Please also comment at that time. 2684. It is 84.

415
02:40:46,035 --> 02:41:01,956
2684.

416
02:41:01,956 --> 02:41:16,920
2684.

417
02:41:16,920 --> 02:41:46,009
A swearing song.

418
02:41:46,009 --> 02:42:01,990
At the edge of the garbage.

419
02:42:01,990 --> 02:42:31,974
I won't forgive you even if you apologize. Hakama on today's broadcast.

420
02:42:31,974 --> 02:43:01,951
Buri Rororo who was confined by the devil. I'll do it.

421
02:43:01,951 --> 02:43:16,976
Such a line. It's ad lib. Ad lib.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 02:43:48,291
You can get out of this hell with 26998 sentences. A little more. 2699.

423
02:43:48,291 --> 02:44:33,245
Get hungry.

424
02:44:33,245 --> 02:44:48,253
until now. It came. 50 minutes.

425
02:44:48,253 --> 02:45:03,252
What have you learned?

426
02:45:03,252 --> 02:45:18,216
Throw away your shame.

427
02:45:18,216 --> 02:45:33,252
I want to.

428
02:45:33,252 --> 02:45:48,168
No.

429
02:45:48,168 --> 02:46:03,175
Perfect.

430
02:46:03,175 --> 02:46:18,218
Achieved one more and 8 minutes left.

431
02:46:18,218 --> 02:46:33,169
Carbonic acid.

432
02:46:33,169 --> 02:46:48,264
A heart shape that is not here.

433
02:46:48,264 --> 02:47:03,249
Handwritten chinos.

434
02:47:03,249 --> 02:47:18,224
TEL has arrived.

435
02:47:18,224 --> 02:47:33,224
by the way. It's a different story.

436
02:47:33,224 --> 02:48:18,293
It's a legend that comes close to me. I'm riding Hartman. A narcissist, an extremely old lady.

437
02:48:18,293 --> 02:48:33,204
I think it's cute.

438
02:48:33,204 --> 02:48:48,262
Don't you do it? Eh, what kind of combination is left over who will come.

439
02:48:48,262 --> 02:49:03,282
1658 What kind of combination is coming? It doesn't matter what kind of combination is left.

440
02:49:03,282 --> 02:49:18,254
Suitable for long-term care.

441
02:49:18,254 --> 02:49:33,237
I don't know this.

442
02:49:33,237 --> 02:51:18,271
I wonder if it's about time.

443
02:51:18,271 --> 02:51:33,273
Weak bullying.

444
02:51:33,273 --> 02:51:48,267
Who is the pig guy? What kind of feelings are you being bullied?

445
02:51:48,267 --> 02:52:03,171
It's fun.

446
02:52:03,171 --> 02:52:33,252
It's not like my grandma has been doing it all the time.

447
02:52:33,252 --> 02:53:18,236
And more and more. 3 hours. Ah-chan too.

448
02:53:18,236 --> 02:53:48,180
finished.

449
02:53:48,180 --> 02:54:18,204
so. 3 hours.

450
02:54:18,204 --> 02:54:33,259
Some seniors watched from the beginning to the end. He took a peek from time to time.

451
02:54:33,259 --> 02:54:48,314
I survived well for 3 hours. It is difficult to increase the number of subscribers.

452
02:54:48,314 --> 02:55:03,169
But.

453
02:55:03,169 --> 02:55:18,238
Many. Stretch your heart.

454
02:55:18,238 --> 02:55:33,270
I think we were able to increase the number of combos.

455
02:55:33,270 --> 02:55:48,290
By the way. There is still more to this area.

456
02:55:48,290 --> 02:56:03,238
There is.

457
02:56:03,238 --> 02:56:33,257
It's a punishment game.

458
02:56:33,257 --> 02:56:48,257
Today's broadcast is a little R 18 points with children 18 prohibited curry.

459
02:56:48,257 --> 02:57:03,260
I think it will be later, so thank you.

460
02:57:03,260 --> 02:57:18,330
From around 23 minutes on May 28th. I'm thinking of broadcasting to the Messe after a long time.

461
02:57:18,330 --> 02:57:48,264
It was the most fun.

462
00:00:00,000 --> 03:00:50,285
What have you been boxing for? Then go home.

463
03:00:50,285 --> 03:01:05,256
It was ridiculous.

464
03:01:05,256 --> 03:01:20,226
Thank you everyone for watching until the end and over 350,000 people.

465
03:01:20,226 --> 03:01:35,234
It's not. A chair like hell.

466
03:01:35,234 --> 03:01:50,232
Vegetables, hair and seniors.

467
03:01:50,232 --> 03:02:50,230
Pants rubber broke.

468
03:02:50,230 --> 03:03:05,171
Thank you for your concern.

469
03:03:05,171 --> 03:03:20,270
Thank you very much. Thank you for the event double squadron, which is vacant tonight and feels like Kansai.

470
03:03:20,270 --> 03:03:35,246
I made the one I used in 8 dimensions.
