00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,141
Where and where did you really come back? Inoue.

2
00:00:30,141 --> 00:00:45,118
No matter where I met again, Tsukiji Yo-Yo is now Tsukiji. You've already moved to Toyosu.

3
00:00:45,118 --> 00:01:00,142
Where did you move? Acolle. Ah, different, different, different.

4
00:01:00,142 --> 00:01:15,163
Where did you get it? Near the Shin-Shonan-Shinjuku line. It is in the same place.

5
00:01:15,163 --> 00:01:30,138
It really resumed. Resurrection.

6
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:45,180
The hall was open, but the feelings remain. It's in the same place. I want to eat it after a long time. Who is that soup men? I'm sorry. Is it so?

7
00:01:45,180 --> 00:02:00,120
Tsurumi Ward. Tsurumi Ward.

8
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:15,148
Macaron A little bit of a useful person on Twitter. here.

9
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:30,133
I want to eat ramen. A delicious shop.

10
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:45,206
But I wonder if I'm quite fond of ramen, but I also like salt ramen, ordinary soy sauce, and miso, so I like the first half of ramen. Also oil level Oil level.

11
00:02:45,206 --> 00:03:00,121
It's more like ramen, but abura soba. I'm going to eat a little bit. Just the opposite.

12
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:15,148
There are no ramen shops in rural areas. I don't have one, but on the contrary, I left the gang town area. Both TOKIO and Kanto say TOKIO, but I ate it after I came to Kanto.

13
00:03:15,148 --> 00:03:30,197
I don't have ramen, but I eat it. There is no such thing as a ramen war. There is, but it's not common because it's powdery over there.

14
00:03:30,197 --> 00:03:45,147
I want to eat ramen at Tenkaippin even if I want to eat ramen at the store. From JAL. It was probably about that level as if I was eating ramen.

15
00:03:45,147 --> 00:04:00,181
There weren't that many things like that. It feels like there is a ramen shop.

16
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:15,166
I don't know if there aren't many shops that seem to do 1.5 of them only with ramen, but I don't know if there are any gangsters other than me. I didn't have time to cook in other regions. Color. Since I came to the big city. You started to eat great ramen.

17
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:30,111
But since I came to that big city, it's like everyone really goes to a ramen shop to eat ramen.

18
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:45,130
That's the part that has changed quite a bit. Personally. That's right.

19
00:04:45,130 --> 00:05:00,176
There is a goldfish There is a certain Dotonbori There is a certain. But I wonder if there is such a reason now.

20
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:15,128
I wonder if there was such a culture of eating ramen. I wonder if I just didn't notice it. Even at home, I didn't really have ramen 2 around.

21
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:30,205
Because I was eating udon soba noodles, ramen noodles When I was about to eat, what would I eat would be udon noodles rather than ramen. That's right, udon was eaten.

22
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:45,133
Even if you change jobs, yeah yeah yeah. Sukeroku set meal written with Inari-san and sushi rolls. I've seen it.

23
00:05:45,133 --> 00:06:00,194
I wonder if there are people on the other side of the soba noodles Gang people People in other regions There are people who tend to eat udon, but there are more buckwheat noodles around me.

24
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:15,149
Sukeroku is this voice actor. You know Sukeroku.

25
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:30,121
In words of Aiue, I sometimes go to cosmos in this region with myself. You probably know people in Kyoto. People around there know.

26
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:45,168
Sukeroku There are sushi such as Inarizushi and Maki sushi. Is it really sushi?

27
00:06:45,168 --> 00:07:00,147
I'm using vinegared rice. It's not like sushi. Oh yeah Inari-san and that fried food Inari-san and the sushi rolls are called Sukeroku.

28
00:07:00,147 --> 00:07:15,145
Why did you say Sukeroku? It wasn't a Kabuki term. I've been curious about it and investigated it. Sukeroku Meaning. Sukeroku meaning.

29
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:30,141
Kabuki's color The man wrote that he was shaking.

30
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:45,230
It is a word derived from Kabuki. Helping is used in sushi. It is derived from the story of Kabuki 18th, 18th, Sukeroku, and Edo Sakura, which was popular in the Edo period. The main character is the origin of Sushi 6 Sushi. The existence of a thousand fried rolls. Oh yeah.

31
00:07:45,230 --> 00:08:00,252
I see. Sukeroku Yuen Edo Sakura's Sukeroku had a headband wrapped around his head and was a purple bee, so he compared it to this suga and seaweed roll.

32
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:15,173
Mistress's roll. Sukeroku sushi is a bento box with sushi and rolls of seaweed that you want to be careful of.

33
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:30,167
I see, it made sense. Horror. It will be useful.

34
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:45,123
Well, I'll stop. How far is 4?

35
