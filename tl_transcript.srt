1
00:00:00,000 --> 02:46:21,500
Can you hear everyone? Container.

2
02:46:21,500 --> 02:46:36,514
It's this week A little bomb Bomb low pressure. We don't attack our journey I've already fallen asleep.

3
02:46:36,514 --> 02:46:50,465
It will be integrated before the fight to be integrated into that ender dragon.

4
02:46:50,465 --> 02:47:06,507
I was curious about what it was, so I couldn't deliver it for a while. You can't make a thick frame or you can stand.

5
02:47:06,507 --> 02:47:21,527
It feels like I have to buy it again when it melts. You came back and forth for the time being, to everyone.

6
02:47:21,527 --> 02:47:36,513
Hypnotize everyone. Everyone's feelings of being pulled back on Monday even though they worked hard until winter.

7
02:47:36,513 --> 02:47:50,492
The kitten's poop smells. If you don't put it in, this OBS.

8
02:47:50,492 --> 02:48:05,483
Did you just do the test? Go out with Masashi Sada.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 02:48:22,322
It may not be said that it is a little complete. I want to sing as much as possible.

10
02:48:22,322 --> 02:48:37,357
There are a lot of things that will be rebroadcast. The quality is so slow that the songs are pretty close in a week, so what do you say?

11
02:48:37,357 --> 02:48:52,331
I'm thinking of singing a new song to the beginning, but I don't understand at first, but today. Shino-san's lie.

12
02:48:52,331 --> 02:49:07,337
I think I'll sing. Please tell me if it's the loudest.

13
02:49:07,337 --> 02:49:22,326
Promise.

14
02:49:22,326 --> 02:50:07,246
continue.

15
02:50:07,246 --> 02:50:37,297
Today's carp.

16
02:50:37,297 --> 02:50:52,288
Dark silver.

17
02:50:52,288 --> 02:52:07,315
Emile Zola.

18
02:52:07,315 --> 02:52:22,276
Hold a promise that I couldn't speak.

19
02:52:22,276 --> 02:52:37,307
I sang Chigusa.

20
02:52:37,307 --> 02:52:52,341
You grew up without seeing Fullmetal Alchemist. I couldn't sing this song, but do your best. Ranking Within 100th place in the karaoke anime song ranking.

21
02:52:52,341 --> 02:53:07,315
I'm thinking it's peeling off It's funny You see, it's really only once.

22
02:53:07,315 --> 02:53:22,371
A voice that seems to be a preconceived idea that he is an uncle in a heavy armor. Someone like Asuka ii's uncle is a cookie.

23
02:53:22,371 --> 02:53:37,329
If there is a mistake, it is a mistake in the past.
