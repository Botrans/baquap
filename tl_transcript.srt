1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,198
I'd like you to see the Marina character even with a mane.

2
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:45,119
I wanted to meet the maintenance of Micra. I understand the song from 19:00, so I wonder if I'll do it at 23:00 or even use it for lunch today.

3
00:00:45,119 --> 00:01:00,137
I have a plan like that. I got a little derailed. other.

4
00:01:00,137 --> 00:01:15,135
After all, everyone is active on Saturdays and Sundays. This and that is fine and fine. I saw Polka doing Micra in the morning.

5
00:01:15,135 --> 00:01:30,147
I saw a stable building next to my park. Someone here, TNT's exploding Okamoto, was really worrisome. I don't know.

6
00:01:30,147 --> 00:01:45,129
Dokin-san is also welcome, Hololive-san.

7
00:01:45,129 --> 00:02:00,220
If you like, please take your time. And if you like it, I'd be happy if you could subscribe to the channel, get a high rating, or follow me on Twitter. Today, it's been a long time since I had a chat. I'm sending it non-stop, but when I look at it, it's not at all. This comment All the chats are like a roller coaster.

8
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:15,173
A picture with the chairman someday. It's hot and there is collaboration. I have one.

9
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:30,149
The guy who speaks English too much I'm a little worried that I'm about to be run over when I'm abroad. Bikkuri Donkey Mita. Bikkuri Donkey's orange juice isn't very good.

10
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:45,147
I'll make a lot of original songs because it's English Morimori.

11
00:02:45,147 --> 00:03:00,168
Because it's a prime time. I'm surprised Donkey-san, I really like the parfait called Merry-Go-Round, but I understand. It's really cheap.

12
00:03:00,168 --> 00:03:15,152
The combination of fresh cream, ice cream and shiratama is too strong. Shirakawa-cho Tell me that you like it. My childhood friend is an elf.

13
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:45,233
A childhood friend from the elf forest Every year there is a child who gives me a birthday present, but I don't know that because I love it so much I don't know what that white ball is delicious, but it's hot. Shiratama has no taste, so I really don't understand. Of course you think it is.

14
00:03:45,233 --> 00:04:00,177
When I was told about the taste, Treasure Island I wondered what I wanted, but at 9 it became like a philosophy. If you say such a thing, then how many children are there?

15
00:04:00,177 --> 00:04:15,186
It's the taste of Kazunoko. It's seasoned. But.

16
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:30,174
Kazunoko If you like it, the taste and texture of Kazunoko. Is it something like a shark fin? Tapioca is certainly, too.

17
00:04:30,174 --> 00:04:45,280
Tapioca Argen Tapioca Seasoned brown sugar-like taste. I don't like that in any country, but I think brown sugar is delicious when combined with milk tea. Nata de coco.

18
00:04:45,280 --> 00:05:00,455
I wonder if the texture is good. That texture is good. That's right. A factory that requires sugar for milk tea.

19
00:05:00,455 --> 00:05:15,168
From the moment you add milk, you can see how much you want sugar. Aloe tends to be put in yogurt.

20
00:05:15,168 --> 00:05:30,399
Aloe is something that makes you want to put it in yogurt. The oil that came out of the prunes Yes, it seems that there was no food I was not good at, but the big one may be a little weak.

21
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:45,234
I don't know when to swallow it, though I've talked about it before.

22
00:05:45,234 --> 00:06:00,408
When I was very tiny, I had that body anemia, so when I was eating that day, I got up and missed the timing to eat it. Big prunes Like raisins like dried prunes Like big raisins. I just need to know.

23
00:06:00,408 --> 00:06:15,294
No matter how it happens at home, it's like Betaro at once. There was an era for me. I might be able to eat it now, though.

24
00:06:15,294 --> 00:06:30,280
I wonder why the food I wasn't good at eating was type 2 if I ate it now. Something. I used to be bad at it, but now I'm adding it at all.

25
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:45,244
There are no such things. I'm not good at it, but if I eat it now, it won't taste good.

26
00:06:45,244 --> 00:07:00,289
He didn't like it a long time ago because I think it might be common in New Year dishes, but now he eats it normally. Peppers Eggplant and peppers have been my favorite since I was little. I've loved it for over 200 years.

27
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:15,143
Stuffed peppers That's about stuffed peppers.

28
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:30,125
When I made it for the first time, I didn't even know how to sprinkle it on the back of the flour peppers. That's normal peppers. Cut them in half. But than that hamburger. I prefer meat stuffing now.

29
00:07:30,125 --> 00:08:00,178
Tsuwano I don't think people who don't cook can understand at all, but if you don't apply the meat stuffing of that pepper to the place where you collect two flours, it will come off only to Yaida, right? It's like that pepper, pepper and meat that was supposed to be Apollo when I made it for the first time without knowing it.

30
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:15,168
Become a mini hamburger. what.

31
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:30,143
I really like onions, so it's minced meat like hamburger steak.

32
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:45,153
I'm happy for the time being, but that's my elf forest's parents' house. Even when my mom makes hamburger steak, I can put anything in it. There are various vegetables in the hamburger steak North.

33
00:08:45,153 --> 00:09:00,205
It seems that the onions are also cut into small pieces. It was a lot of vegetables like that, so even if you eat that pepper meat stuffing, it's so much. It seems that the kanji that contains vegetables hasn't changed.

34
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:15,159
Peppers and stuffed meat When it comes to peppers and meat, there is nothing in that meat.

35
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:30,130
After all, it's stuffed with bell pepper meat. Hamburger tofu.

36
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:45,156
For hamburger steak, sprinkle onions and salt and pepper in the minced meat, so why not put your favorite ingredients in it? I have an older brother and a younger brother. Somehow that is also the case. It's in the middle.

37
00:09:45,156 --> 00:10:00,123
That's why it's quite that d **. It's like anime color.

38
00:10:00,123 --> 00:10:15,132
That scolding was the biggest cause, and that older brother liked that kind of thing the most. This d ** It's funny, so it's not everyone.

39
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:30,143
Something is flowing and it's at that house. Sound is leaking from the color sister speaker. I think I often listen to this song.

40
00:10:30,143 --> 00:10:45,141
I often hear that, like lending that Siri or something. I said that it was a good song and asked me to listen to it often. The song I remembered is so awesome.

41
00:10:45,141 --> 00:11:00,087
Is coming to be attached.

42
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:15,243
Work I started to research various works that human beings like, and I started to like various things, but I wonder if I liked the good works quite a lot. Clash Royale I tried to find it myself. Air and Kanon liked his brother.

43
00:11:15,243 --> 00:11:30,108
I was told by my sister, but it's not the original, but the all-age version. Lend me your brother.

44
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:45,147
That's the first time I heard a wet touching key work is possible. Forget about me. I won't say thank you.

45
00:11:45,147 --> 00:12:00,184
Ayu-chan is my favorite Hanane because it's the best, but I understand. What time is that girl in your house?

46
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:15,095
After all it is going. It will be crushing. That's the manga that my sister liked.

47
00:12:15,095 --> 00:12:30,111
This may also be pretty scary. Two people who are good at a little naughty manga. Like Oyama Kikunosuke.

48
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:45,149
This area may be close to old. I saw this area quite a bit.

49
00:12:45,149 --> 00:13:00,153
magic. I like it a lot, but it's a little more naughty.

50
00:13:00,153 --> 00:13:15,129
When I'm adolescent, I get excited again. By the way, if I could go, they also watched that anime.

51
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:30,149
Wonderful is that. I was looking at the sky. Let's Nupunupu.

52
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:45,099
Di Gi Charat. What is it? Masaru-san too. Or the Urayasu Reinforced Family.

53
00:13:45,099 --> 00:14:00,113
It's too wide. It's too wide. I've left it outside of this. That naughty story that can be anything.

54
00:14:00,113 --> 00:14:15,168
It's not far from ancient times. It's too strong and everyone will be crazy, so it's so spontaneous.

55
00:14:15,168 --> 00:14:30,126
The type that can never be seen again now.

56
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:45,139
I think it's a little bit stronger. Is not. After that, various things. I liked her the most, but I like her.

57
00:14:45,139 --> 00:15:00,144
I like the painting visual of body.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,205
I like Pita Ten Apita, but I also like Kamichama Karin.

59
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:30,191
It's completed properly, isn't it? I want the hero to be happy if possible, and the ending that makes me foolish makes me a little lonely.

60
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:45,252
It's finished properly, and it seems that each person has become independent, but it makes me very sad that they like each other but are separated from each other. I want you to aim for the happy ending now.

61
00:00:45,252 --> 00:01:00,117
The feeling of excitement of the elementary school students at the opening of Tenten-kun is amazing.

62
00:01:00,117 --> 00:01:15,143
Hanasaka Tenten-kun Opening That chaos that I'm crazy about. chaos. After all, listening to it raises the tension.

63
00:01:15,143 --> 00:01:30,167
That's right. That's right, is it jumping?

64
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:45,143
It's not about flying sake, it's true. A little. Somehow, the image of the time when I was about to spit it out. It seems like it's a jumbled poulet.

65
00:01:45,143 --> 00:02:00,119
That Satoful I think it's going to be rolling now. Somehow Akazukin Chacha liked Shiina-chan, but I changed to take it.

66
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:15,094
I worked on it and changed. Poppy is cute.

67
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:30,161
I'm sorry, I don't understand at all because it's weird. Apart from that, I don't think about that coupling.

68
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:45,158
I like Yamazaki the best than Obocchama-kun.

69
00:02:45,158 --> 00:03:00,179
I want it, but who do I like Otani-kun and I like that taiko club, so I like that Taiko-no-Kai relationship. It's blown away.

70
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:15,167
Gag manga Even in Asia, gag manga is sure to help, and now the part is out. Gag manga It's Katekyo Hitman REBORN with a ribbon that I said a little.

71
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:30,125
I'm not so familiar with it. Why is it like that?

72
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:45,159
I remember crossing the mountain. From now on, 8 minutes and more, Korokoro Bonbon knows only 5 people who dance.

73
00:03:45,159 --> 00:04:00,144
It's over, but that. Surprisingly narrow.

74
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:15,159
I'm a Marmalade Boy, but I'm curious, but I don't remember 10 stories. I liked the mint na Bokura. I saw a troublesome bag. Saber Marionette.

75
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:30,178
I watched anime a lot, but I don't remember much now. I love You. I don't really like the end.

76
00:04:30,178 --> 00:04:45,140
That child's toy. It was really good. I wanted you to go I wanted you to do as the original. Something.

77
00:04:45,140 --> 00:05:00,156
It's okay to go with the original or anime, but the thing is the Mizunokan. It's one of the works I'm doing in children's toys, but I don't know at all whether I've taken that child. That hero is doing entertainment activities.

78
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:15,184
It's like a hot-selling child actor. What kind of character is it, but it's an insanely energetic child actor. That younger brother Thunder boy.

79
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:30,102
I'm talking about messing around with that, but only at the beginning. It may be good.

80
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:45,175
It's kind of like Marie, but what's the matter? It might be the same as when I came, and the anime was also interesting today. It's great, but that anime.

81
00:05:45,175 --> 00:06:00,126
The way it ends is really delicate. I handled it. I'm thinking.

82
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:15,107
But after that, I really liked Hayama's relationship. I like various manga artists because they say that they've hit various manga, but they never fall. It's been important for a long time.

83
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:30,099
It probably comes with the St Dental story. Surprisingly that marine is that white. It may not be that wide.

84
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:45,150
Marin and the guy Marin made this because I also like it.

85
00:06:45,150 --> 00:07:00,159
I wonder if it's white. I think it's a little biased, but even if it's biased, I think I'm seeing a lot of people that everyone knows. There are quite a lot of works that the demonstrators are watching. I often think that I'm a girl.

86
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:15,153
An image of looking closely at a man's accessories. Something like a jump. I like my ancient friends Well, I wonder what that is.

87
00:07:15,153 --> 00:07:30,136
If you understand this, it may not be serious, but it is a sound cartoon called bond candy.

88
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:45,176
That's it, but that higher candy is a girl who taught me how to make a child who taught me manga. Curious thief God is the one who also teaches me.

89
00:07:45,176 --> 00:08:15,145
It was that child who taught me, because it's a pretty boyish work, a boy's favorite work, or a girl who likes it, and I went with a little cool feeling. I think I like that kind of thing. Today, I liked that Duel Monsters the most, but that hand was pushed by the beautiful sea.

90
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:30,206
Really do it with 6. That person is that. I liked the coupling. I'm a girl.

91
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:45,198
But I'm glad I was taught the work that I like, and I wasn't told by that older brother, but that child really teaches me about this.

92
00:08:45,198 --> 00:09:00,161
You may not have known it, or you may not have met Planetes. That's why I feel that this encounter is quite like making my favorite work.

93
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:15,149
That's right, so it's fine. I like it. Arakawa Under the Bridge recommends me.

94
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:30,200
I'm really disappointed with Wonder. I wonder if there was something like that during school breaks or something like that. Arakawa: Manga is more interesting than anime.

95
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:45,134
That wait is wrong. I think anime has more momentum, but Arakawa is also a manga.

96
00:09:45,134 --> 00:10:00,206
I want to earn money by encouraging the shock that comes out. so. Nan curry. There is anything.

97
00:10:00,206 --> 00:10:15,127
It's moving so much that I don't know if it's become fat and has stalled a little. Anime should have more momentum, but manga is more.

98
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:30,168
It was a lot of fun, but that. There was a manga in front of that Arakawa.

99
00:10:30,168 --> 00:11:00,211
Somehow about 3 short stories there Nakamura Kobo Nanamura Nakamura Kobo I was taught by a manga called Nakamura Kobo I had talked a little before that school bag I said I want a school bag That kind of child who wants a school bag Mama repeatedly persuaded her to persuade her, and that school bag was too wasteful.

100
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:15,138
Too much I don't need this, I don't need it, but kids will certainly not need it in the end. I don't react when I go to school with a certain thing I like everything. I don't know, but I really like it.

101
00:11:15,138 --> 00:11:30,137
It's called Nakamura Kobo. Among them, I like the feeling of pushing. I'm doing until the sky graduation.

102
00:11:30,137 --> 00:11:45,150
Estimate for those who are interested. I like the development of something like that.

103
00:11:45,150 --> 00:12:15,171
The Idolm @ ster is Cinderella. I'm a character. Why can't I talk about Cinderella Girls? I wonder if there's that child as it is. I'm not familiar with it, so that's not the case. I'm going to be very rude in my diary, so I can only talk about it.

104
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:30,270
My heart hurts. Haru-chan, I like it, I like it, I like her voice, because she's close, I feel like her voice is already moon.

105
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:45,164
I like Rina too much.

106
00:12:45,164 --> 00:13:00,107
It was too cute and too interesting, so I was a member. Thank you. It's a mountain sand lolicon hoihoi.

107
00:13:00,107 --> 00:13:15,139
I would like to recommend Yuriko Fuchizaki to those who like Shota voice. For girls, Misaki Kuno. What is it?

108
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:30,152
I like Misaki Kuno, who called me because she was so cute. For Shotabo, I usually like Yuriko-san.

109
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:45,141
If it's a voice, I like that Mutsumi Tamura. Like.

110
00:13:45,141 --> 00:14:00,168
The book cards are completely different, so the way they are divided changes a little. I also like Mie Sonozaki, who has completed the boy's voice.

111
00:14:00,168 --> 00:14:15,121
I like UQ Shower Madoka. I like Madoka. I like the voice when I feel like menstruating. Such a stupid me.

112
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:30,153
I like Madoka's acting at that moment to death. Clio's boy Voice and Moon 23 are said to be geniuses.

113
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:45,181
It goes through my mind, but there is some penance. I like it. I prefer Shotabo, who has a clue to his voice. Clear W.

114
00:14:45,181 --> 00:15:00,182
If you think about the voice of that line, I think it's like that. It seems like it's from that voice.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,137
I really like illustrations. Professor Sugisaki He was a teacher who could go to Sugisaki.

116
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:30,151
It's cute. It's a Sanwa boy's voice, isn't it? The sound distinction of Shotabo is fine.

117
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:45,125
I also like the rest of us. Konabeshima, Soma City A year later.

118
00:00:45,125 --> 00:01:00,145
That's the person in that match. Um um um. Gucci likes female voices better, but he likes big thieves.

119
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:15,132
That's right. I really like Maaya Sakamoto's Shotabo.

120
00:01:15,132 --> 00:01:30,150
I really like the boy's voice, not outside of Maaya Sakamoto.

121
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:45,165
The impression of that girl is strong. The impression of that plant is strong. I like Tomoko Kawakami, who is a girl.

122
00:01:45,165 --> 00:02:00,143
Yukari Tamura, however, likes songs quite a bit. Licca-chan Gappa The most impressive thing may be that I've seen a lot.

123
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:15,182
You can reach the goal.

124
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:30,113
Far. Is it about to end?

125
00:02:30,113 --> 00:02:45,153
It's about time for everyone to have a heart and a heart. Did you enjoy the otaku talk screen today? Let's do it again.

126
00:02:45,153 --> 00:03:00,130
It's noon even in the morning, morning and morning. The ancient talk was very biased. Highly rated picture book Removes dirt from the floor.

127
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:15,180
Everyone likes it if you take it. I'm watching it, but I saw it, but I didn't subscribe to the channel last time, but I said it's been a year since I joined the member.

128
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:30,116
There is such a thing. That's a lot. It's been around for a long time. First of all, what is this?

129
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:45,117
Thank you. I'm subscribed to the channel. I would be grateful if you could subscribe to the channel.

130
00:03:45,117 --> 00:04:00,121
Train channels, subscribe and member rush. We are talking about naughty stories about member-only distribution, so please subscribe to the channel that everyone was happy with.

131
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:15,125
Fishing Doraemon Taku-chan and I got rid of it. Why why?

132
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:30,173
What did you talk about? Subscriber What did you talk about how to register as a member? I haven't invited anything else, but somehow I thought I should enter now.

133
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:45,206
D ** story. Scryed Planetes.

134
00:04:45,206 --> 00:05:00,408
Puni Infection Seriously my bible A course like the bible that decided my life. I'm not looking for a dream.

135
00:05:00,408 --> 00:05:15,116
I remember being able to stay.

136
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:30,340
De Do Do De Da Dada It's because of that perfume Perfume I won't sing How much perfume I remember I'll give it a try I'll do a song frame. I didn't remember after judging with Minato. I'll fix it that night or I'll do my homework at night.

137
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:45,182
I remember you guys properly.

138
00:05:45,182 --> 00:06:00,126
I remember the perfume.

139
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:15,259
If you don't do a little research, you won't understand even if you ask.

140
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:30,252
This is the white one.

141
00:06:30,252 --> 00:06:45,250
LINE is with you because it's suddenly vacant in the middle of the night.

142
00:06:45,250 --> 00:07:00,254
At that time we were two people who felt like we could do anything. I took a lot of pictures.

143
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:15,261
I had a stomachache. I can't feel anything even if I hurt it.

144
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:30,230
It's because of your Dolce & Gabbana perfume that you remember.

145
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:45,092
What should I put in the trees listed above?

146
00:07:45,092 --> 00:08:00,158
I can only say it with my mouth.

147
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:15,143
Suddenly, if it's a cigarette name, I'm not sad. I'm not sad because you just changed.

148
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:45,127
Your Dolce & Gabbana who doesn't ask for you but remembers to be next to you.

149
00:08:45,127 --> 00:09:00,120
I can't love you again. I'm irritated.

150
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:30,112
When it was fun.

151
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:45,162
I'm not asking for you suddenly, but I remember being able to lie down. It's because of that perfume on the bedrock.

152
00:09:45,162 --> 00:10:00,132
You are such a nice person that you will love it again. Repeat me.

153
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:30,132
Yes. homework. I tried to take a mount that says I remember a little, but I failed.

154
00:10:30,132 --> 00:10:45,180
What's inside? It was written that it was different from the perfume I knew, so I remembered it too.

155
00:10:45,180 --> 00:11:00,143
Perfume. Yes, this is what it is like this.

156
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:15,124
That's a little unique entry. But. It was like in the middle of the night.

157
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:30,127
It's quite different from the beginning of the subtleties, but this is fine. Thank you. It was like a rush.

158
00:11:30,127 --> 00:11:45,090
I think it's today. The number of members I met today is strange for male magic. Something from 70 people.

159
00:11:45,090 --> 00:12:00,139
Thank you. Also, go out with Ota Talk. I want to talk about a nostalgic anime.

160
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:15,146
Only channels There may be a lot of releases since I subscribed to the channel today. Thank you. It was a little fun. I feel like I posted it.

161
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:30,168
I'm grateful for this year as well, so I'm wondering if I should close it for a moment and choose the name of the Super Chat that I'm receiving now.

162
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:45,118
I'm thinking of starting a song frame from 19:00, so if that's okay, I'd like to see that as well.

163
00:12:45,118 --> 00:13:00,172
Mike This is a cheeky song in the summer, so I feel like I should be able to sing for about an hour with a microphone, so I'd be happy if you could come there as well. The ending that became an adult.

164
00:13:00,172 --> 00:13:15,137
Takuro Will you stop here?

165
00:13:15,137 --> 00:14:30,124
Yes, I would like to go with pajamas 4 for a moment.

166
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:45,187
Put some water in front of the spazio You can bring it to the bathroom while putting some water in it. Because it may get longer once. etc.

167
00:14:45,187 --> 00:15:00,125
It's okay for everyone to go to the bathroom for a while. It's a Kamen Rider story. I'll go, please wait with a good boy.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:03:30,105
Did you wait for me now? Good guys are here. Came back. I'm back.

169
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:45,163
I'm afraid I accidentally deleted one tab now. Sazae-san I don't know how far I've seen it.

170
00:03:45,163 --> 00:04:00,126
I'm watching Sazae-san on Amazon Amazon Prime now.

171
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:15,127
You can revive the tab, really. I erased only 3 tabs. I also love Firefox 3.

172
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:30,147
Wait a minute, where is this little Micra. Micra. I've been thinking about it for some time.

173
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:45,131
Polka Polka Polka I will definitely take you home. I'm summarizing. Because it arrived and I can't kill it.

174
00:04:45,131 --> 00:05:00,097
Because it's Sapporo.

175
00:05:00,097 --> 00:05:15,128
Tsukimiya, S prefecture.

176
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:30,179
Moreover, the incident that changed the title occurred in two years. 3. Yes.

177
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:45,134
I was wondering how many people were smoking, but I wasn't surprised that the incident was bad here. I made a quote.

178
00:05:45,134 --> 00:06:00,180
ZOZO ZOZO. I'm not so familiar with it.

179
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:15,154
It may be like this, but if it's something that you know for that reason, it's a little unlikely. It's like I can't sleep because my sister loves me.

180
00:06:15,154 --> 00:06:30,119
Something. D ** I think it's likely. Like.

181
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:45,142
It's unlikely, it's amazing. It seems like it's amazing. I think it was a homage to that kind of attitude.

182
00:06:45,142 --> 00:07:00,141
It's shining. It's too early tomorrow, so I'll enjoy it again. Search for original material after a long time.

183
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:15,152
If you make it a story-like title. Will be pleased. There was certainly a title. It seems that only those who come out know.

184
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:30,127
It seems that I'm using it without knowing the original material. You see, I got it from everyone, but that's good because I didn't know the original material at all. I think it's likely.

185
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:45,179
That was what came out. I've heard a lot about that popular Nico Nico Douga, but this one.

186
00:07:45,179 --> 00:08:00,132
There are quite a few. After seeing that and listening to that story, I was wondering what it was like.

187
00:08:00,132 --> 00:08:15,210
If I bought a manga, would it be that heavy? Only in front of that flower Kaze, which visual net I liked, so I was told that everyone had a stick. I searched on YouTube, which was taken in the video.

188
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:30,114
I like it in the video. Search the video to see the moving animation.

189
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:45,149
It was a really good voice. He was a voice actor, but Toshiya Fujisawa.

190
00:08:45,149 --> 00:09:00,182
That's because it's not at all. I'm not familiar with that pachinko yet, but I thought it was amazing that the grass image was like a pachinko song, so I listened to it.

191
00:09:00,182 --> 00:09:15,135
Even if I put on that man's radio song for a long time, I listened to it so much that I got into it, but that kind of original story. Everyone should be careful because it can be buried. Be careful.

192
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:30,139
It's not that I heard all of that, I'm the one who recommends it. If you listen to it all, you can listen to it for free on Amazon Prime, so the result of listening to it. Papanets vs. Hornets.

193
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:45,110
I think it was different if I stabbed the moon, boys and girls. I really liked that guy.

194
00:09:45,110 --> 00:10:00,118
It's kind of like a squadron thing. I saw the guy who was singing with me in the video, and I liked that one.

195
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:15,124
Oh yeah, the doctor's singing was really cool. I bought that one.

196
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:30,176
I really like carp. The director of the Marriage Bureau feels heavy. I felt like Ecchan's favorite Denpa song.

197
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:45,245
I have a rash on my play. It sounds rude, but I really like it. I didn't step on it.

198
00:10:45,245 --> 00:11:00,417
I like this a little crappy feeling I've always loved it and bought it. I love the radio song I bought first.

199
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:15,412
I thought it would be like this if I sang.

200
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:30,271
Somehow, there is a guy who covers the song of Chihiro Yonekura, such as that Taiko Nozomi of Hoshin Engi. It's a different song, but it's an image song of Hoshin Engi.

201
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:45,323
There is a guy who is doing it. There is a guy who is singing by Yukihiro-san. I like the guys covered by the voice actors because they are so passionate. The butterfly kiss is in the first place.

202
00:11:45,323 --> 00:12:00,292
Do it live. I want to see a song called Alive and a book that only you are addicted to.

203
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:30,460
Alive with a smile and a bouquet is an image song of the Sealed God's performance, but it seems that there are many people who have never heard of it, not the anime one, but I really went to an album I've only heard it on the album.

204
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:45,229
There is a Taiko Nozomi version. It looks like it's great again.

205
00:12:45,229 --> 00:13:00,304
Oh yeah yeah this is also why people who really know I've never heard that I don't really like Hoshin Engi, but it's messed up and I've never heard that child likes it In the feeling that it's useless The one on the CD. I think many people haven't really heard of Hiro Itano's version.

206
00:13:00,304 --> 00:13:15,292
I really like the cover of my favorite character. I've never seen that Fist of the North Star.

207
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:30,115
I wasn't so familiar with it, the manga artist. What is it, Keiji of flowers.

208
00:13:30,115 --> 00:13:45,137
It was cool, it was cool, it was cute, you were the only one. I don't know.

209
00:13:45,137 --> 00:14:00,112
It's my dad's manga. I haven't seen a votive tablet that might have helped by chance. There may be others, too.

210
00:14:00,112 --> 00:14:15,103
The reason why I can't read that major work is probably too long. While I was thinking, I feel like I'm gone. That's right, the innocence is cute.

211
00:14:15,103 --> 00:14:30,138
That's why it's a manga. Keiji Hana 1 I'm addicted to it. Akabane Labor I don't know. I really like the song.

212
00:14:30,138 --> 00:14:45,193
Everyone is overwhelmingly more detailed than I am. Legoeva wants to see it someday. Wait when you start watching, it's a little scary, Sazae-san.

213
00:14:45,193 --> 00:15:00,123
After all, I don't feel like that. What will happen? Concentration in the middle now. It's the same as Psychopath.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,165
I don't know if I don't look at it I got a little different Mario I didn't know if I did that I would have to go back and forth again and again. Rampo Kitan has returned many times.

215
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:30,117
I saw it because I could open the spoiler history once.

216
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:45,166
That's likely to happen, so if you're busy, let's drink delicious at once. If I watched all the anime, I saw Mister Ajikko several times. I also like Rampo Kitan. I also like Bungo Stray Dogs.

217
00:00:45,166 --> 00:01:00,295
I wonder if you can see it without having to concentrate on it. If I saw mom, I bought a manga. Up to the best in China.

218
00:01:00,295 --> 00:01:15,262
I don't really understand it now. Don't get angry. I'll get angry.

219
00:01:15,262 --> 00:01:30,292
Cooking Mama couldn't see any video sites I knew about Cooking Mama. There are things like recording on metal or TV, but I didn't have a chance to see Cooking Papa.

220
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:45,145
There are some places where people don't see it now. I haven't seen so many works.

221
00:01:45,145 --> 00:02:00,211
It is often said. It's said that vtuber was the first to be barefoot on Scryed.

222
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:15,215
I'm glad that I know the work that everyone likes, but I'm sorry I didn't win at all. That's right, I don't know at all.

223
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:30,114
Even though I'm trying to remember a major song, I don't think I'll listen to it. I heard about tigers and so on.

224
00:02:30,114 --> 00:03:00,219
A friend of mine who really likes painting was the one who came to help me when I moved. I think I told him that he loved it and played BGM all the time, but I haven't seen that anime at all. The scene comes to mind at all because I really like Kaoru-kun, so Iku-kun's name appears in the scene.

225
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:15,170
That's right, it's kind of like that book, it's like it's raining at all I don't know at all.

226
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:30,200
In the end, I didn't know if I was doing something that only I knew after that. I'm sorry to say that the unfettered shogun.

227
00:03:30,200 --> 00:04:00,152
I saw the Unfettered Shogun, but I'm going to work on it, but I'm going to get stuck in the land afterwards I wonder if it can be made rhythmic quickly. totoBIG Why do you meet there? I thought, but how to write.

228
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:15,203
I really wonder why I did it. But thank you for helping me move. I think so. I derailed I immediately derailed.

229
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:30,195
Kaneda-san I'm sorry I can't sleep because I can't sleep because I'm working from now on. Thank you so much for the two of you to come back safely. After that, Furukawa lost his dream, but he made his own meaning.

230
00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:45,138
Thank you for the souvenir. A miracle moment wind Eat or survive?

231
00:04:45,138 --> 00:05:00,235
The sample may change today. I hope it doesn't become the last word when they are cute. I pray for the establishment of the conversation. I exchanged it several times, but I'm angry. Polka has grown up too. Wakana's is also with people.

232
00:05:00,235 --> 00:05:15,459
People are useless. That person will guide you, so it's okay. When I feel like taking care of me.

233
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:30,170
You can't be too relieved. It's pretty easy in that situation.

234
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:45,250
I think it's surprisingly noticeable to go on an adventure and collect it by yourself. Maybe that chocolate teacher will be taken.

235
00:05:45,250 --> 00:06:00,452
I think I taught each other that I want to do this, not LINE, which says I want to know what to do or what I can do. I knew what I wanted to do. Both of them are on different routes.

236
00:06:00,452 --> 00:06:15,488
It was out of focus, but I said I wanted to build it, so I knew there was something like this, so I couldn't beat it.

237
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:30,480
I learned how to make a dream because everyone can do KREVA, so I wonder if I can enjoy something again. It seems that I was doing Micra today, so I found that way of enjoying myself and then it suits me. It's up to you.

238
00:06:30,480 --> 00:07:00,162
The child who will continue to go with me for a while and I was having a little fun at that time, but if it wasn't really the case, it can't be helped anymore. From here, I'm going to cook with you. I want to do this, but I don't know how to do it, so I think it's just right to work for the first time when I'm told to teach it.

239
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:15,418
My brother, I thought I packed a lot, but I was talking with that Choco-sensei or two people after that delivery, but I was a little confused.

240
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:30,305
I've been doing it for a long time because I thought that I couldn't do it because I thought that I went early, so I'm sure if you tell me first I was saying that time. I think it's good.

241
00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:45,302
I think I might be interested in Choco-chan or maybe I'll look it up later. The reason for doing that in Zozozo.

242
00:07:45,302 --> 00:08:00,257
After finding something that you want to do, you can do it yourself. It's up to you whether you want to continue or do it behind the scenes.

243
00:08:00,257 --> 00:08:15,217
Even though I'm not interested in it, I can invite you many times because I want you to do what you like. While living. Furukawa: I said I wanted to go to Hanahata, so I went to Hanahata for a while.

244
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:30,152
I'm going with you, but I'll leave it to you if you want to do something else or something else.

245
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:45,159
If I drop too much, I won't enjoy it anymore, so if I'm in trouble from here onward. I want you to listen. The public bath seems to be frustrated.

246
00:08:45,159 --> 00:09:00,139
Maybe I'm not good at Micra or something with a high degree of freedom. Whether you want to go or not It depends on Marin, so even mom.

247
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:15,135
Rather than pulling a cat, you see, I'm Micra. But that. Everyone knows if it is. So that.

248
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:30,132
I wonder if it's okay because I'm invited by Marin. I'm pulling something forcibly.

249
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:45,122
If you tell me you want to go, I think I'll schedule and prepare. If you don't know how to enjoy Micra, I just taught you how to enjoy Micra. It depends.

250
00:09:45,122 --> 00:10:00,153
I'm happy, but after all that. There are many people who say they like it from before. I think it's some kind of good content, and even I, who has a communication disorder, goes quite a bit.

251
00:10:00,153 --> 00:10:15,141
It's kind of fun to have a sudden collaboration. But are there people who are good at it or people who are not good at it? I can't force you to take something underneath.

252
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:30,127
I like everything, but I wonder if I can tell you what I can do, and I wish I could help.

253
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:45,207
Meitetsu 07243 F Paul's big adventure student High school student Koshien I don't seem to be able to rear tie because I'm not in good physical condition, but I hope the adventure ends safely But the title story is too old Who went to Is it?

254
00:10:45,207 --> 00:11:00,143
It's decided. I haven't called it. Somehow this is that pure.

255
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:15,134
Camellia-san Aikotoba-san 450,000 people So I quit music Thank you for being 300,000 years old. I'm looking forward to the first collaboration with Polka-san. That's it.

256
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:30,136
It's okay because I prepared it as if I went to the preparation room carefully and tried to write it. The length of the house is that again.

257
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:45,172
I thought it was a game and played it evenly, so I felt like I wouldn't die in an accident. Long-term care to stand.

258
00:11:45,172 --> 00:12:00,159
Mr. Choco's Polka took care of him thoroughly.

259
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:15,129
I thought I shouldn't overdo it too much, but I'm sick. I'm worried that I'll die or Polka will die and return to the initial respawn point. I'm most happy to be back, especially for the first time, to see what I can do.

260
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:30,165
I thought it would be very painful if either one died, so I prepared it a little more and I wish I could enjoy it.

261
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:45,148
I was saying that it was okay, but it was like that, so at the marine festival, Polka usually used that bow to help me.

262
00:12:45,148 --> 00:13:00,189
After that, I feel that if I can adventure alone, I can't do anything alone. Honestly. That equipment and bulk.

263
00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:15,217
I think that even one person can recover at all if I get a little more. If I find that fireproof potion or a thread to defeat a temporary touch.

264
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:30,139
Somehow, I was fighting with that blaze quite firmly, even with a bow and so on, I wondered if Paruka was going to the Nether alone, but even if I went there, I got naked sushi, but let's do that adventure outside that delivery I can understand how confident I was.

265
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:45,124
I didn't have a fireproof potion because of what was club activities.

266
00:13:45,124 --> 00:14:00,116
I didn't even know the possibility that Polka didn't know how to return all of Gacchan's attacks. I didn't think it was too packed because of this, but I also have that Yumi, and that already attacked. I didn't tell you that it was a polka attack company. That position position.

267
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:15,128
I don't know that I can turn it back in the first place I don't even know that I can rent a house on my way home. Please tell me how to find out.

268
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:30,150
I wonder if. I think I should have told you at that time. For the time being, I'm only teaching you how to fight safely, as if you wouldn't die anymore.

269
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:45,119
I wonder how I will learn this way.

270
00:14:45,119 --> 00:15:00,240
But if you're interested, I'll go on an adventure alone in the Nether. When Haruka rang, I think everyone should tell me. I think everyone will teach me the stock, so from here. Even if there is, it is Polka's ability. If I needed much more, he would rely on me and I didn't need it. I hope you can help me.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,151
Buzzwords and I quit music. If there is any new song.

272
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:30,195
I'm doing my best if there are things that I haven't told everyone about. Mr. Kaneuchi I'm really looking forward to what will happen to the Frepro collaboration. How was it? Thank you for your enjoyment.

273
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:45,267
Thank you very much. Thank you Mikamo I'll throw it before I try to go to bed Thank you. Koko Suka Koko Suke-san Thank you for coming to work.

274
00:00:45,267 --> 00:01:00,265
voice. Mr. God, I haven't turned around anymore. This is a polka that is a pottery. Thank you.

275
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:15,148
It's coming in light rain and fog, and Kiriki is gone in those 5 seconds. ..

276
00:01:15,148 --> 00:01:30,316
This is you. Please come here. Someone will come here, but next is Inoue. It was white though.

277
00:01:30,316 --> 00:01:45,250
It's cute, isn't it? That story is the same with me. Choco-sensei Choco-chan.

278
00:01:45,250 --> 00:02:00,129
so cute. Yukihiro-san I hit my cheeks because my face was so sick that I couldn't smile so much.

279
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:15,271
Parc told me that it was fun after the delivery, and that was the first time for me. It seems that she rushed in strongly after not thinking that Anna or I was super scary, Dad.

280
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:30,224
Something like how to use words. It's too close and I hit him roughly. I'll hit him with a kotatsu. I asked him that it wasn't hard to talk.

281
00:02:30,224 --> 00:02:45,236
It was fun. I was so happy because he told me that it was really easy to talk to. If you like it again, please play. I was so happy that I invited Hanahata.

282
00:02:45,236 --> 00:03:00,190
If you talk for a long time, there will be no delivery. If you say polka that isn't sleepy, it's not sleepy. I'm still awake.

283
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:15,172
I ended up resting well, but I asked him to talk to me about how to imagine it. When it feels like you can play, the sea is gone.

284
00:03:15,172 --> 00:03:30,135
Well, that collaboration. Somehow Polka doesn't have to look for a conversation or prepare a talk deck, and the story goes on and on.

285
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:45,151
I thought when I sang. Something is wrong with that. There is, but I don't seem to care at all.

286
00:03:45,151 --> 00:04:00,130
I thought it was so easy to talk to.

287
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:15,181
I heard that you can't sleep well even if you drink charcoal powder, but if you don't get enough sleep, you can easily get sick, so I think you should go to the hospital just in case. I pray for your health. ..

288
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:30,225
Nakasu: I don't really rely on sleeping pills because I can sleep when I can sleep and I can't sleep when I can sleep. If you're sleepy and not tired, you're probably sleepy.

289
00:04:30,225 --> 00:04:45,136
I'm sleepy, so I stopped taking it, so it's about time I just tried taking that over-the-counter sleeping pill.

290
00:04:45,136 --> 00:05:00,117
That's right, I think it can be judged as that sleeping pill at all.

291
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:15,172
I'm tired of working with the dome, working until I'm sleepy, doing only that work, and when I'm sleepy, I feel like I'm sleeping like I'm dead. Fortunately, I am.

292
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:30,162
It's not like what time everyone is at home now, but I want to get up at that favorite time, work at my favorite time, and go see everyone at my favorite time. You're doing it like that. I don't know if I'm feeling well with this.

293
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:45,153
The delivery time is too long and I'm feeling sick underneath, but maybe I want to be too sleepy. That's why.

294
00:05:45,153 --> 00:06:00,137
I wonder why it's almost impossible to sleep. I'm so busy that I have to get up at that time and I'm short of sleep.

295
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:15,180
What I have to do and what I want to do is past Paris, so I don't think there is a good balance between it and time. That said, there are too many meetings and I can't get around, so I just don't want to take a break from the delivery.

296
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:30,175
I know they will do it, and I know you should take a day off, but that's why I take a day off.

297
00:06:30,175 --> 00:06:45,173
It's correct, but when I take a rest, I feel sick or come to mental health. I think that when I take a rest, everyone forgets about me.

298
00:06:45,173 --> 00:07:00,166
I want to be by my side, and that kind of feeling is stronger than taking a rest. So I want to deliver it if possible every day. But when it's really impossible, it's like that day. Sometimes I take a day off.

299
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:15,156
I wonder what that guy is. I understand how worried you are when you take a rest. Because I know the best.

300
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:30,153
It's okay because I don't deliver it while putting up with the fact that I'm about to vomit. It's not like I'm delivering while having a fever and feeling like I'm coughing.

301
00:07:30,153 --> 00:07:45,251
That's right, I'm taking a rest. I had a slight headache, so I thought it was in this state.

302
00:07:45,251 --> 00:08:00,167
My head hurts. It's kind of like that, I thought that if I played a game in this state, I might get closer, so I took a break and tried to sleep properly.

303
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:15,114
Even though the judgment is correct. I think it's basically a good time. But I'm very happy to be worried.

304
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:30,157
I think you care about it. Don't make it a hobby to worry. For your hobbies, watch my stream. I'm worried because I'm most happy to say that sleeping is my hobby.

305
00:08:30,157 --> 00:08:45,185
I don't think so. So I'm happy, but I'm worried. My story I think it's the most fun to come to my wife.

306
00:08:45,185 --> 00:09:00,117
To meet me. That's why I'm coming to see it. I would be happy if you could come to see me with that feeling. yes, I'm good.

307
00:09:00,117 --> 00:09:15,193
I don't think I talked about otaku a while ago, so I'm having an emo conversation. I went to the dentist.

308
00:09:15,193 --> 00:09:30,160
Sakata I can't do it, but thank you. Thank you, Mr. 8. It's under Sagan I haven't seen it under Saga, but it was just under the gravel.

309
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:45,128
Yukihiro-san It's regrettable, but I'll be the first one. It was long except I thought it would be a successful one. Choco.

310
00:09:45,128 --> 00:10:00,150
It's been a long time since the distribution was called Enka. That is. Enchantment It's not that important, or something like that. If you open it on the way, this should be a good thing. If it's true.

311
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:15,143
Choco-sensei is that.

312
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:30,199
Enchantment I was wondering at what stage everyone was addicted to chocolate, but I enchanted that teacher from myself. Torishige enchantment This is from around peeling off. Even if I keep telling you after this, I will complete that enchantment.

313
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:45,164
Over there. It's very efficient to defeat Enderman, so it's usually efficient. I thought I would go there.

314
00:10:45,164 --> 00:11:00,141
I started peeling it off with a whetstone so that it would flow.

315
00:11:00,141 --> 00:11:15,159
The height I got was a hindrance to the chocolate in that nice place. It's okay if it looks like a river. If you do it with 2G, it will take you until morning. You can stop it, but I would still continue, but what?

316
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:30,164
Explosion resistance is also good. Tsurushima This time, I can't stop because I feel like I'm okay with this.

317
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:45,095
It's really funny because I said it was a waste when I moved to an athletic man.

318
00:11:45,095 --> 00:12:00,156
Something is falling It looks delicious I was trying to judge it, so somehow flare stream delivery is different Later, after seeing Mita's chocolate choco touch Micra's mystery delivery tag, after seeing everyone's comments on Twitter After delivery, then the counter level.

319
00:12:00,156 --> 00:12:15,103
I'll go to the point where it wasn't 20,000, but it's just another 1 million yen. A diagram of the relationship between 12-ary numbers and so on.

320
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:30,163
I felt that there was a person who posted it in the image. It's over 1 million, so 120 is a single digit I'm sorry I'm wrong. That's right.

321
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:45,128
It's an image like Disgaea. The ultimate replay game. It's scary that there is nothing else you can get at the supermarket.

322
00:12:45,128 --> 00:13:00,104
Even if I raised it to 120, that little bit.

323
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:15,181
Disgaea is reincarnated in Tahara, so it's not wasted. As for the level, if you die for a little bit, only 0. I'm crying for a while today and stop Micra.

324
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:30,111
There is nothing, but there are so many. As a result of working so hard, if I lose it, it will be today. For a while, I'll be micra with a still image of a void face image.

325
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:45,158
Mute. Thank you. It's too painful.

326
00:13:45,158 --> 00:14:00,158
13 Kai Aoi Kyoichiro-san, I'm sorry for the work I'm doing today. Thank you for having fun with Polka-chan. Thank you for your work.

327
00:14:00,158 --> 00:14:15,117
Chest 6 Fortress Strategy Enjoy Tokkuri cooks rice in the archive. Everyone was feeling like they were going to do it.

328
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:30,121
My delivery is all long, Micra and GTA will be long by all means Stop the world. So I don't think so.

329
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:45,154
I'm crazy about it. Yamanaka Polka was telling me at all. In the times, to Mita's Polka and Choco-sensei.

330
00:14:45,154 --> 00:15:00,143
Ask me what you want to do, like let's stop if you get a little tired. I said I wanted to go to the singer's fortress, so I'll eat a lot of time.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,128
I'm Polka Whenever I hear that I can go today. He said that, like I'm going.

332
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:30,155
If the ball breaks on the way, that. One point I'm a person who can do it for hours. BEATS Two Shot Drama Giants.

333
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:45,148
I think I'm happy because I enjoy doing what I'm doing, but I was a little worried that it would be okay.

334
00:00:45,148 --> 00:01:00,171
Especially when it comes to polka, when I see him doing solo micra today as usual. I'm glad to think that you're addicted to something. He said he enjoyed it.

335
00:01:00,171 --> 00:01:15,140
Those who said that it was fun again I thought that they might have said that it was really fun to use the collaborations for the first time, but it was a straightforward feeling.

336
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:30,092
Click crack. Robin Robin.

337
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:45,049
translate.

338
00:01:45,049 --> 00:02:00,130
Exciting.

339
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:15,138
I couldn't understand it even if I translated it, but I think I'm probably in Polka. Wonder. Locally. Maybe.

340
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:30,201
I feel like that, but I feel like I'm saying it. Thank you. No.

341
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:45,099
Translate your name. I don't know the first.

Good luck and good luck in Japanese. Thank you for the earth.

344
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:30,146
Thank you very much for your return to the great adventure. I'm looking forward to the architecture. I wish I could make a glittering house for Polka. This is also a translation. Wait a minute.

345
00:03:30,146 --> 00:03:45,169
It was a fun collaboration. Thank you. Thank you for the weather forecast. Also, call Polka soon.

346

349
00:04:45,197 --> 00:05:00,179
I think it's the participation of listeners. I think it's a katakana person, but thank you for watching over me. It was a lot of fun.

350
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:15,150
Panda Stone 3 Adult Bull. I'm glad I was able to return safely. Thank you. Minecraft This is.

Ah, this isn't the time, but suddenly the three collaborators, Miko-senpai and Haruka. That supermarket.

353
00:05:45,140 --> 00:06:00,162

I'm going to see it, but I'm sleepy today, so I'm going to sleep. Good night. Thank you. Don't overdo it. Thank you for your hard work.

356

I believe Thank you for coming to see me anytime. It will be a holiday tomorrow to connect the road construction. I'll run until I'm cut off. I'm sorry if I fell asleep.

357

Thanks dear. I've been short of sleep lately, so I can only see it halfway, but I'll be entertained until then. Thank you. A picture of Micra with my favorite idiot in the distribution.

358

It will be a very nice birthday gift Thank you I am looking forward to the road construction Thank you. Thanks dear.

359
00:07:15,198 --> 00:07:30,159
Both the voice of heaven and the voice of Micra Moe-chan get a feeling of coming from the front. I thought I'd play a game. I just happened to think that it wouldn't arrive before that.

360
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:45,162
I had all of the polkas, and everyone played polkas, and I thought I'd play a different game once or I'd be foolish, but I thought I'd do something different I tried to do something like a motorcycle today. I felt like that.

361
00:07:45,162 --> 00:08:00,156
I wasn't told anything by anyone, but it felt like I should have done Micra through in my mind.

362
00:08:00,156 --> 00:08:15,080
My class monster. I laughed to death.

363
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:30,185
It's kind of cold, isn't it? Why is the polka in your crotch with an emoticon? The dragon was wearing it. That's why the shark came up.

364
00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:45,104
Why do you say that you don't know where you are looking on the cover when you have such a face? When I wear it, I get angry and thunder. It's normal, but I don't know why.

365
00:08:45,104 --> 00:09:00,166
He had a really dignified face. I wonder what it was. It was a bug, but it was really interesting. It was also interesting, but Doutor was completely messed up. I've got a horse, but I really like it.

366
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:15,131
I wonder if it was east. It wasn't. Say it's not because you rushed in.

367
00:09:15,131 --> 00:09:30,142
This time that. I wonder if I should put in my resume.

368
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:45,134
The ancestors are not accepted either. It's not English to move. I wonder if I'll give a little money to commemorate the founding.

369
00:09:45,134 --> 00:10:00,159
Ryomo Avocado A Pokemon that really likes the coccyx. But maybe, but that's cancer. Did you chew at school?

370
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:15,161
Many cream-colored foods don't come. It's not, but that kind of nostalgic school is cream-colored. In the image.

371
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:30,157
It's quite spoiled because it reacts to such bokeh and tsukkomi.

372
00:10:30,157 --> 00:10:45,143
I like Kamata's sharpness so much that it's really blurry. ZOZO ZOZO. I'm sorry, I want to study abroad when it's completed.

373
00:10:45,143 --> 00:11:00,148
Richard Keita I'll do my best to create a fashionable road Thank you. I'll put in today's sentence before I fall asleep. Thank you for your money.

374
00:11:00,148 --> 00:11:15,140
Tsubasa Tsubasa Thank you. You lost it in front of the warehouse.

375
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:30,187
When I put the wrong bucket, it seemed to be on the chest as it was palletized. Shun Isaki Shiranui Flare Dressed Husband is leaving cool.

376
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:45,105
Or soup-san, Noel. Tax payment.

377
00:11:45,105 --> 00:12:15,211
It's a rare item that you can sometimes get if you sacrifice a lot of chickens in your skirt. Something like service arrows. When I summoned Wither with that creative, I tried summoning it and how far it was. I wondered if it would affect everyone, or if I tried it for a while and how fast I could beat it behind the scenes.

378
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:45,452
I didn't see how crispy it would be if I drank the potion, but when I tried to see how much it could be beaten on the normal ground, I didn't have any chickens, but I feel like I've fallen a lot Otherwise it won't come out. It doesn't come out unless you sacrifice a lot of chickens. I didn't know.

379
00:12:45,452 --> 00:13:00,390
It was an image that I sometimes drop it when I attack by spinning around. Anything that a mob killed by a wither drops will do. Hey, I've been vs that day since that day.

380
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:15,149
Which one will win?

381
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:30,186
At the same time as summoning that woman underground in the creative, I'm a clear creative, so you see, in a state where you can't be attacked. I didn't know which one would win.

382
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:45,132
I didn't say that. Sky-high. That pizza flies high, so it goes up and goes up, but it doesn't reach.

383
00:13:45,132 --> 00:14:00,199
I can't hit it by jumping and I'm dead. Anyone else has a large amount of unilateral lizard attacks.

384
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:15,140
I think I can win the full tank. It was fun, but there are 9 that I dropped a lot. But it's a little regrettable Wither Rose this time.

385
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:45,131
I touched the skull and gave it two. That skull of my mob Maybe it's about here, so maybe I'll try it once. That chicken I think it's like summoning that wither and defeating it a little at the same time. .. If it's something like Beacon, I'm sure it's annoying. If you feel like you're wondering, tell me if you're proof that day.

386
00:14:45,131 --> 00:15:00,197
You can only do it creatively, because you probably didn't. Beacon lighting is used. Something like that.

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,143
I'm going to make a proof with a beacon. That Micra diary is going.

388
00:00:15,143 --> 00:00:30,172
It looks like. I want to take arrows. He said that he would have to put out Wither Rose when he mounts it on the next Pecora.

389
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:45,157
By the way, I feel that the other mobs have three heads, a creeper, Sasuke-san, and a zombie. Please log in after delivering with Mr. Choco.

390
00:00:45,157 --> 00:01:00,163
Tai, Tamano-shi Tamano When I was working, it was a bit of a thunderstorm. I was crazy. I cut it.

391
00:01:00,163 --> 00:01:15,122
Toilet messenger is super cute today. It's always cute.

392
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:45,293
Shigure Tsukazan It's a big birthday today, but I'd like to celebrate this year as well. I'll pay this one. I'll continue to support Flair-chan. I love you. I love this birthday. I feel like it was done on that day This is because I feel like who threw it when I was working, so I think it arrived directly. That Happy Birthday to You sang. Thank you for the octopus trap. I'm celebrating, so I'll omit it today, but thank you very much for your happy birthday.

393
00:01:45,293 --> 00:02:00,190
May this year be a good year for Tsukasa, and this year I hope I can spend time with me and do something good with me. What do you say?

394
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:15,195
It's not just about sharing. I can make good news. I hope you'll feel good about pushing it and fighting W. I'll do my best again this year.

395
00:02:15,195 --> 00:02:30,142
Thank you for the door and everyone.

396
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:45,134
I completely forgot that it's my birthday today. I'll continue to support you. Thank you. But I was wondering if I could read it.

397
00:02:45,134 --> 00:03:15,175
I don't know how much it costs in Japanese yen because it's just the starter that was thrown in this, but I'm thinking of starting a song frame from 16:00, so if I'm satisfied with that, it's a little bit. I read only the super chat that I threw directly today, today, and today at the next party, but I also read a little about the Micra collaboration with Mr. Choco.

398
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:30,191
That wing When it's dark, that morning activity I think I'll read that I threw it today. I'm sorry it's a little off.

399
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:45,191
Sometimes I don't understand the spatter science of bugs, but depending on the amount of bugs, I feel like I've thrown a lot of them today. Thank you, Murasakizuka. It might be better to blur it a little.

400
00:03:45,191 --> 00:04:00,167
The song is a dark talk and voice body. I'm really sorry, I think everyone is looking forward to it. It would be nice if there was no song frame for the first time in a while. I think that is the case, so thank you. Thank you uncle Junkin.

401
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:15,185
Yellow-green 8 Lacotta I searched for it and it looked like a green worm. I used to think it was a fashionable block. Alasar You may think that you've been happy and tired all the time. The color is like citrus and it's so cute.

402
00:04:15,185 --> 00:04:30,164
Even though I thought that something was like citrus or something like that, he said that it was like a worm-eaten leaf. Is disappearing.

403
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:45,100
The delusional Lord Camus. That's true of the castle over the mountains and Kamasa.

404
00:04:45,100 --> 00:05:00,139
If I wasn't told, she would always say her. Say your body is sick. Didn't you tell me? At school, everyone can only see it at school.

405
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:15,178
I want to enter it. It looks like there is no school. I saw it because I was saying it.

406
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:30,086
AO admission cup. Isn't it AO admission? But I really liked the glitter at that time.

407
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:45,149
Shiranui Flair Now I'm chatting while working. 8. I can't read this in China, so I'll try to translate it.

408
00:05:45,149 --> 00:06:00,156
Nep 3. Cat-san That romaji from cat-san. I was sick, but this was how I read it. Thank you Nepu-san. Thank you parent and child.

409
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:15,144
Mr. Osomatsu at home Throw it first so that you can fall asleep at any time. Thank you for the laid-back atmosphere of the delivery from the front of the bill. Thank you Pool Flamingo-san It's early tomorrow so I'll see the rest in the archive.

410
00:06:15,144 --> 00:06:30,149
Momiji-san, a rabbit bun. Please forgive me for this today.

411
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:45,213
I'm sorry for the child's drowsiness because it's worse than I expected. Good night everyone. If you get sleepy, don't overdo it, but everyone's kind. When you go to bed, it feels like you want to sleep with your friends.

412
00:06:45,213 --> 00:07:00,160
Everyone's physical condition Just as everyone is worried about my physical condition, I'm also worried about everyone's physical condition, so don't overdo it. That's why I had a chance to see the anatomy I hadn't seen when I took a rest in a hurry.

413
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:15,115
You can also leave the tomatoes.

414
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:30,209
Then, I wonder if it's a little hurry to take a break. It's been a little too long with just flares. It's raining, it's not playing, but I'd like to see the delivery of other children. There may be. I want you to be absorbed in it forever.

415
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:45,168
It's okay from noon, but that. I wonder if I will start. It's good to leave one, and sometimes it's good to go to bed early.

416
00:07:45,168 --> 00:08:00,153
The sound is good a little earlier. Holo mackerel maintenance Good luck Good night Thank you. Thank you for your hard work.

417
00:08:00,153 --> 00:08:15,179
If it's just coming, I'd like to make and use various things. Thank you Mr. Harada. Thank you Tomoya.

418
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:30,119
Thank you for putting it in. Even if I made it by myself, I really like the architecture of the shrine maiden, but that's what.

419
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:45,161
Ikemura: At first glance, it's really fashionable, but what's Mamiko's house? Only that throne feels a little subtle.

420
00:08:45,161 --> 00:09:00,135
The other places are really fashionable houses and people I don't know why it was cute like a cookie, but that song seems to be awesome. I wonder why I'm not good at it. Maybe senior manufacturers will get messy if they use the middle.

421
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:15,199
I think I have that architectural sense. Tsumura is really cool, and that's why the shrine is really cool.

422
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:30,149
But for some reason I tried to make that cool thing. Is it income?

423
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:45,132
Yes Hello's weather forecast.

424
00:09:45,132 --> 00:10:00,135
Mario 3 Miqo'te Throne I laughed until I got a stomachache when the horizontal bonfire looked like a ball case. After all, Micra collaboration I thought I was looking forward to it. You've become mild.

425
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:15,158
I thought I should have put it in the waterfall instead of saying that soul sand, but what do you think? I thought a little later that the Takigi Noh was burning or not. I didn't expect it the most.

426
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:30,130
The way of thinking in the ball case was amazing. After all, I think that it may be the bonfire that makes the kettle and coolest in architecture.

427
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:45,090
If you want to make it terrifying, the road behind the Wither Skeleton's head.

428
00:10:45,090 --> 00:11:00,146
You shouldn't put your visa head in that castle of your seniors. Miso-zuke and that suke also don't enjoy the bath over there. neck. A cart placed behind or beside the frame The 4th stuffed stuffed neck looks like stuffed neck.

429
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:15,108
It's tiny behind. I think the skeleton is good. That's the light skeleton headlight at the entrance of the house.

430
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:30,129
What is it? Not a blaze rod. The white one.

431
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:45,152
That one. The head of more veneered skeletons. If you leave that one behind.

432
00:11:45,152 --> 00:12:00,243
Feeling a little noisy. Levorg has 2 end rods and that. I'm sure it can be made with.

433
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:15,171
I want to push it out with a piston like that and see it. If you just want to decorate your head, put it aside and push it out with a piston and push only the head part with glass.

434
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:30,267
Because it's fashionable. It was a very nice atmosphere Thank you. Tamao was so cute Thank you.

435
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:45,261
When I laughed so much that my stomach hurts, it was fun to make it when I thank you. But it was really fun for me and Polkam was fun. I came up with a hat to wear.

436
00:12:45,261 --> 00:13:00,193
I'll ask you what was interesting.

437
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:15,252
Samson Take Polka If I hadn't seen it, I was completely out of my hometown when I was doing it with my coccyx.

438
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:30,276
It was really fun to stand in a bluebonnet and stand dignifiedly. It was hijacked. Was funny.

439
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:45,303
Kyoichi Aoi Anatomia Ikeuchi Lawson Advance Can processing Thank you. My magic hall is a little Yoshihiko Boss I tried to show up.

440
00:13:45,303 --> 00:14:00,152
That pretty early cat, Yoshihiko's boss. It looks like I've come to lower it. Because there was a bus that looked like a great bus. Sacrifice already.

441
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:15,107
You don't have to take it. I want to see the mountain god. Image data.

442
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:30,183
I think I should take it home. Yes, I understand. It's amazing, the boss who said something, it's really light, and I like that kind of boss more.

443
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:45,132
This level is already good.

444
00:14:45,132 --> 00:15:00,184
I haven't seen if it's a sudden plan or not. That middle ride is pretty clear even with that gag, so it depends on the person whether it fits the skin quite well, but if you like the feeling like the gag anime that you cut before I recommend it.

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,098
translate. I understand that it says that the end will come.

446
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:30,133
BenQ Pro Vs bar. Thank you for the blessed laughter Flair's best. I don't look down.

447
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:45,105
But I don't think I've been messing around with that. Because it's easy, it's impossible, so it's messed up. it was fun.

448
00:00:45,105 --> 00:01:00,153
Thank you very much for going to the red stop without this. It might be over there. Everyone knows a little about the cause of bullying.

449
00:01:00,153 --> 00:01:15,138
There is a former story of bullying. Chipmunk-kun Bonobono sound. Clionidae.

450
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:30,081
Bully while tilting. cute. We're fucked!

451
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:45,131
Put such a small story in chorochorochorochoro. I don't know. That's right.

452
00:01:45,131 --> 00:02:15,144
Hachi-san Today's broadcast Thank you so much for having fun I also enjoyed my thank you Thank you for having fun in the countryside account Thank you very much Thank you Thank you Thank you very much.

453
00:02:15,144 --> 00:02:30,163
Thank you for your hard work. In terracotta, the mackerel grass was very fashionable and reminded me of Santorini Island in Greece. I quickly realized that there was a lot of fun and time for the sudden collaboration. I want to change the decoration of.

454
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:45,224
I want to use it for a while on pavement. The weight of the chest 6 was saved.

455
00:02:45,224 --> 00:03:00,156
I'm looking forward to your school. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens to Demon Castle. Why did you contribute to the global environment? It was a great day to see how many squid I got. Thank you.

456
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:15,302
I laughed so much Thank you for saying that everyone laughed with a stomachache on this day. Hiro-san is interesting. Tired of having a stomachache.

457
00:03:15,302 --> 00:03:30,128
There were a lot of things that weren't happening. Thank you. Thank you so much for understanding.

458
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:45,281
It seems like I can't sleep so much at this time in the Greed Haircut collaboration. I've seen it to fall asleep, but I want to see it. Just next door is the best Thank you.

459
00:03:45,281 --> 00:04:00,252
I intended to collaborate suddenly Thank you. Of athletes. Thank you.

462
00:04:30,326 --> 00:04:45,137
I was too busy to go home, so I want to retire this time. Hope desire. There was something like thank you. I'm sorry I'm celebrating my birthday, so I'll send it until this year.

463
00:04:45,137 --> 00:05:15,212
I'm grateful to send you a new year's gift, but I'm happy that I can see it even in my spare time. Thank you for the sound I'm thinking about, and even if I can't get it, I'll always see 10 people in the shadows. I thought it would fit my feelings.

464
00:05:15,212 --> 00:05:30,197
I've been riding with you, but I want you to come and see me anytime. When you're busy, don't overdo the sound. And it's your birthday.

465
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:45,134
Happy Birthday to You Happy Birthday to You. Half birthday. Century egg.

2. I'm sorry I couldn't celebrate directly because it was a sideways collaboration. It was a birthday song, but I wish you a wonderful year for Peter.

467
00:06:00,155 --> 00:06:30,204
It's a good thing, so I can't quite hit it because I can't come to see love, but I'm lonely, but I'm glad if you come to see me even when I'm a little calm. Thank you for the souvenir. The train thanks to the reference to the GT distribution of the bill.

468
00:06:30,204 --> 00:06:45,189
Thank you so much. If you watch my ZU stream, it's already. What is a car license? I was confused. I will be punished.

469
00:06:45,189 --> 00:07:00,115
Get angry. On the other hand, teacher stock.

470
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:15,228
That's not the case. Instructor 8 The brake is stepped on. The instructor has stepped on the brake only once.

471
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:30,118
Yeah, I'm on my way home, but this one time. That actual Nezucchi, so that child is about three or so random, but once today.

472
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:45,125
Only one of the three exam courses. There was a course, that's uh.

473
00:07:45,125 --> 00:08:00,151
8 to the right. The author from the right turn is like snow. It's like putting out one more time, turning, and then putting out another turn signal.

474
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:15,128
Such a course is an attack run. This one is successful.

475
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:30,193
There is a course called this, and it's very difficult until I get used to it, and it's awkward, and at the same time I do it at that time. Something about the car I was selling.

476
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:45,117
The behavior is strange and when I do the operation or the test, I bump into the car and that pot. It is said that it was stepped on once when it was tempered.

477
00:08:45,117 --> 00:09:00,101
It happens very rarely, but when it happens, it's like shit.

478
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:15,169
It's dangerous to have a car because it happens not only to me but also to the person running next to me, but I was angry and stepped on it once. I was told that this was unavoidable. Also for instructors.

479
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:30,134
If I had any advice, I was told to calm down so that I wouldn't panic when something happened. After all.

480
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:45,147
The light is that one, this one isn't going, the other person is going, the other person I saw earlier is running straight, so it's open. There are times when I go to see it at all.

481
00:09:45,147 --> 00:10:00,220
If you think that the bend is the priority over there, I think it's better to say this, but I'll wait for a while, but if you wait for a while, I'll tell you that there's no point in it. It seems that I'm thinking about the same thing over there and coming out in front of me.

482
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:15,133
That's right. It's like unlucky.

483
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:30,171
I haven't handed it over for about two years when I drove the car. I don't have that, but there are times when that happens. That's why I start reading the air with the other person. Cars are scary.

484
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:45,110
I can't tell you anything, so I'm gonna pick you up with a gesture. I have no choice but to buy something and tell it about the movement, but I think it seems to be transmitted at all over there.

485
00:10:45,110 --> 00:11:00,193
There are people who signal with blinkers. Flash last. Someone who tells me that there is no light on it.

486
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:15,172
The person running behind is kind, and the light isn't shining. Someone who tells me that it's time to help, or something like that. It's like pumping. Kuro-chan or something like that.

487
00:11:15,172 --> 00:11:30,183
It's said that you can't push it, but what is the current situation in Japan? it's not.

488
00:11:30,183 --> 00:11:45,145
Who are you guys? It's no good to honk as much as possible. I would have felt if I hadn't been there.

489
00:11:45,145 --> 00:12:30,269
Grandpa Oshiruko I personally celebrated my birthday on January 22nd. Last year I didn't have the courage to take Spa-chan, so I was jealous of the LL people receiving congratulations, so I threw this year. I think it's been a while since I was born, but could you give me a word? I'll continue to support you. Happy birthday to you. I'm sorry I couldn't say it on the day. Maybe twins. Then. Happy Birthday to You.

490
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:45,149
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, Grandpa Oshiruko. Thank you very much. I hope it will be a wonderful year for my uncle. I think that last year was a year that I worked harder than that year when I made my debut.

491
00:12:45,149 --> 00:13:15,140
This year, even more than last year, I thought that everyone would definitely want to achieve that surprising goal. The first goal is to release two or more videos that I sang last year, more than last year. I hope the day will come when we will release an ori song.

492
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:30,148
I want to do various things such as copyright. I wish I could do my best in such a place.

493
00:13:30,148 --> 00:13:45,199
That's right, I'm hoping that everyone will be able to appear in the media more, or that I'd like to have more opportunities for everyone to know about it, so I'll do my best in that kind of place, so this year, I hope you'll spend this year with me.

494
00:13:45,199 --> 00:14:00,120
Even if I could do my best so that people would think it was good, it would be different if I wanted to get off and live. Soba That group. I've already sung the song.

495
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:15,140
After all, disposable consumables run around all the time on the art truck. Don't worry. So I. Candy merry-go-round.

496
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:30,127
I don't know the type of sunflower flower. Even for 9 weeks in a row Daily Diary I heard it for the first time, but I really like it.

497
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:45,135
Pull 10 consecutive gachas.

498
00:14:45,135 --> 00:15:00,147
I don't go to the Denpa song, but it looks like that older sister. That kind of light novel and something else is everyday. Opening like that voice actor.

499
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,124
That's right. It's not, but that everyday Lucky Star Azumanga is like the Great King.

500
00:00:15,124 --> 00:00:30,134
I say so, but I can see it if I leave it alone. I like it because it feels like the opening of an anime. The one who looks sloppy.

501
00:00:30,134 --> 00:00:45,104
It's the same with Kasuga, but it's really. If you ask me what's interesting, think about the cat in this work. Steins Gate is expensive, isn't it?

502
00:00:45,104 --> 00:01:00,142
This is what that girl is like.

503
00:01:00,142 --> 00:01:15,168
But I'm trying my best, it's not like that, Kasuga or something like that, my sister or something like everyday life, that Azumanga Daioh, I don't know what's interesting, but I don't know what's interesting. It's something interesting. It feels like a work, but it's not that interesting.

504
00:01:15,168 --> 00:01:30,128
A work that I want you to exist as a matter of course. I want to put it on the right side. Sazae-san is also in that category, but some kind of TV.

505
00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:45,170
When I go back to Tanaka's house and stay alone, I feel lonely, so I turn on the TV for the time being. It's the same as I saw. Like. OK doesn't feel like that. I feel relieved just because I can hear the voice.

506
00:01:45,170 --> 00:02:00,135
It's not really interesting, but it's like eating oranges. It looks like.

507
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:15,147
Somehow, this character is like a house that repeats over and over again. Somehow, even though I'm a little confused, I've braided something. If it's so frustrating, I think I should stop watching it. It's common to break up, isn't it? Katsuo It's like forgetting your homework every year.

508
00:02:15,147 --> 00:02:30,145
Why don't you help my dad? I forgot that test once. It's kind of like going to Katsuoka, which stands in that corridor.

509
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:45,162
After all, it seems that my father, who was pitiful every time, helped me. Even though I think so, it seems like I see it every week. Something like that.

510
00:02:45,162 --> 00:03:00,175
That's why I'm annoyed, but something like this. I don't feel unpleasant and I always want to see it. A work like that.

511
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:15,164
A daily diary with the image of everyday BGM. I want to add animation. Yes.

512
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:30,150
Thank you 1090 years old Thank you for up to 47 sheets. Congratulations to Mama for the first time in the sun. Is it the delivery of Flair to heal the tiredness of everyday life?

513
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:45,142
Polka Polka. Raised Caligateau.

514
00:03:45,142 --> 00:04:00,181
Congratulations to 470,000 people I think I can retire, so I'll open it. Have fun and enjoy the archive. How was it? Almost purple refreshing image. Maybe.

515
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:15,111
Choco-sensei The first four chocolates. Tell me if it's so full. I think I'm tired of it.

516
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:30,160
I'm doing some work, I'm also doing marks, I wonder if it's okay I'm having fun with other people, so I'm wondering if it's okay to explain it very quickly.

517
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:45,132
I'm worried about dirt, but I'm addicted to it. I'm stepping on it.

518
00:04:45,132 --> 00:05:00,140
You haven't seen chocolate at all. It was like a style that the bathhouse stopped a little. What are you worried about?

519
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:30,177
I don't know at all, but I can't keep up with the details and details, so I'm worried that I'll end up not knowing what I'm doing. If you think it's not overloaded, you're probably worried about it.

520
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:45,216
Congratulations to 470,000 people at the moment of the meteorite. Thank you for your continued healing. Congratulations on over 470,000 people. Thank you for all the fun delivery. Don't forget to enjoy it. Health is the most important thing. Niigata Shinkin.

521
00:05:45,216 --> 00:06:00,157
Somehow, this is a clear difference between boys and girls, but I want everyone to remember when teaching girls, but I don't want to teach them a little, but I can do it properly. Please put on.

522
00:06:00,157 --> 00:06:15,161
If you can do it to that extent, teach it to that extent and read it. I don't know why.

523
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:30,174
I'm glad if you teach me what it is, and I'm glad if you take care of me too much.

524
00:06:30,174 --> 00:06:45,151
It's fun to have an adventure with me, Asaba Pecora, and the burden. I'm talking about that. For girls who don't know what to do, I'd be happy if I went to the rear with Choco-chan.

525
00:06:45,151 --> 00:07:00,176
That still and nose and that. There may be quite a few girls who have gone to do what they can do when it comes to the wind.

526
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:15,143
It's the difference between a male brain and a female brain, but I feel that girls will be happy if they go quite a bit. Oh yeah yeah.

527
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:30,136
I think it's definitely more fun to do it yourself. Girls do quite a lot. I think there may be more children who seem to remember.

528
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:45,182
Talking to everyone, that's what everyone feels great. Everyone says that if you do that, it's not overkill, but even if you go, it's better for the girl to put in a cigarette and quit.

529
00:07:45,182 --> 00:08:00,138
I think there are quite a lot of things that don't happen if you say something a little overkill. Something like this. I think there are quite a few things that would make people happy. That's right.

530
00:08:00,138 --> 00:08:15,186
If you are interested, you can do it yourself. Girls are such creatures. I think it's troublesome.

531
00:08:15,186 --> 00:08:30,218
I like it, I like it, I want to rely on it. I want to rely on the person I like. I'll do it myself. This is Saturn's.

532
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:45,126
Something because I like something. I'm coming, I want you to do it, so you see, Azusa.

533
00:08:45,126 --> 00:09:00,192
Takanawa Mita isn't flirting with you, isn't it? If you watch Tomo-chan's drama, it's not the main character, or a rival character. It seems that a specific patient can't help it.

534
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:15,117
It's like a female chimera who is flirting with a woman. Half half, half joking, half like blood.

535
00:09:15,117 --> 00:09:30,155
I may be laughing, but I have a feeling that I want someone who likes me to help me. Joker. I don't know, I heard it.

536
00:09:30,155 --> 00:10:00,199
I'll look it up myself, but if I can go through something, I'd like to rely on it. I'm delivering it, so everyone knows the stupid, so I'd like to ask everyone. I want to believe that everyone will tell me. I'll probably look it up tomorrow, but myself. It seems like that. I've talked a little complicated story that makes me wonder if there is a place.

537
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:15,184
I want to rely on everyone. Congratulations to 470,000 people and congratulations to 470,000 people. Purple protection Purple soba Thank you.

538
00:10:15,184 --> 00:10:30,150
Thank you until Aaron 470002. Thank you Taki-san, 470,000 people. Congratulations to Sazae-san for 470,000 people. Thank you.

539
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:45,145
Congratulations to mom Murasakizuka Thank you. Congratulations to 470,000 and thank you for Purple Spa. 47.

540
00:10:45,145 --> 00:11:00,144
I don't think everyone does that, of course there are men and girls. I don't know about male adults, but it's fine.

541
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:15,140
Play various games with girls. Feel the dance. That little girl who played with me.

542
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:30,147
I thought that there were probably many things that I felt. Someone who taught me enthusiastically later. I quit that.

543
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:45,165
Well, for each person. It's annoying. It's an annoying creature. After all it is that.

544
00:11:45,165 --> 00:12:00,199
Yes Now Yes Now when everyone falls in love A lie. Congratulations to 4 people. Early 500,000 people are coming soon. Thank you. Thank you very much.

545
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:15,128
Congratulations to 470,000 people Thank you. Thank you. Congratulations to the 470,000 people who got it. Thank you.

546
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:45,180
07 people reached 470,000 Congratulations We are one step closer to ordering. Even BLOOM has reached 500,000 people up to Bloom. And I will make my own mistakes so that more people will know. Thank you. Almost almost purple Thank you Super. I'm still thinking that I'd be happy if I could go to 500,000 by the time of the live.

547
00:12:45,180 --> 00:13:00,108
As far as I can. I am thinking. 403 Thank you for the 470,000 registrants.

548
00:13:00,108 --> 00:13:15,126
Congratulations to 470,000 people Thank you Penguins Congratulations to over 470,000 people Thank you. Congratulations on over 470,000 people Thank you.

549
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:30,137
Dick 470.9 cm. Mr. Mogi Congratulations on over 470,000 influenza. Thank you.

550
00:13:30,137 --> 00:13:45,121
Congratulations on reaching 470,000 people. Thank you. Congratulations Shiri Thank you.

551
00:13:45,121 --> 00:14:00,211
Congratulations on occasional dance Thank you, is there Mr. Hatsumi? It's Saturday. It's a little sunny sky, so if you have any concerns, please feel free to leave a comment.

552
00:14:00,211 --> 00:14:30,167
Congratulations to Mama Thank you Mochikura Flat 470,000 Congratulations And personally, it's been 3 months since I joined the member on January 22nd, and I'll be back again in 3 months. I'm telling you to take me, but my thoughts on the future are from now on I love uneven dentistry Thank you. It's been three months to say that some kind of autumn will come. I wonder if that is the case.

553
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:45,171
Whether or not Puni is doing this. Maybe that fun game. Even if I'm really into it.

554
00:14:45,171 --> 00:15:00,142
I wonder if it's been about 3 months since I had some time to settle down. Do you say that it becomes a rut?

555
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,081
I wonder if I'll look for something a little different.

556
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:30,156
I like this too, but I don't know what I'm doing. What I'm doing isn't changing. What I'm doing isn't changing, but I think it's been about three months that I feel like I'm getting unsatisfied.

557
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:45,137
Even after 3 months, when I think I still like it, it continues for quite a while, but I can continue to try manga and anime that are doing that work, but it's been 3 months. Three months.

558
00:00:45,137 --> 00:01:00,134
I wonder if there is something fresh about it, and when I talk about it for a long time, I wonder if even a little thing starts to bother me.

559
00:01:00,134 --> 00:01:15,159
That's right, it ends with 12 episodes that I endured watching anime. There is such a trend, then. Then there is a possibility that people will leave.

560
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:30,117
Maybe it's done. Certainly this may be more.

561
00:01:30,117 --> 00:01:45,141
Hey, all the anime and so on are Van Cool 3 months.

562
00:01:45,141 --> 00:02:00,195
I'm convinced, but I still want people who have been doing it for more than 3 months to continue doing it, so I want to do various things.

563
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:15,232
The number of people who have become Afro should be at least half a year or more, so I think there are people who haven't had a year yet, so it's been another year, so I'll do my best to update the batch, but I made that. There is a possibility that the batch will collapse. It's painted, but when it comes out, you may not be able to see what it looks like.

564
00:02:15,232 --> 00:02:30,152
I'll use it as a stamp when I buy a house. I make it like that in advance.

565
00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:45,109
It may change because it is likely to collapse. I might make things. That's why that batch is a doll.

566
00:02:45,109 --> 00:03:00,173
Thank you for the rain because it feels like it's completed once again at Kintsuba Afro. I was worried about something.

567
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:15,173
Everyone is coming through the regent, so please enjoy it when you are a regent. Mr. Elephant who takes the blue Ozawa Mr. Elephant It's been a long time, everyone. Congratulations to the 4.7 billion routers who are happy to be able to re-tie for the first time in a long time.

568
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:30,132
I had it, I had about 60 million. Please come and see me anytime.

569
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:45,150
Thank you for my work Kiyona-san Shiranuhi Construction. It's my job, so I'll throw it before going to bed. Thank you. Mr 7 ln 3.

570
00:03:45,150 --> 00:04:00,113

I'm sorry Noel won't betray me. Thank you.

574
00:04:45,108 --> 00:05:00,159
It was fun Thank you Akira-san Thank you for your hard work I was able to sink in Numao-numa again, so I don't know until Choco-sensei takes Micra next time I don't know if that Choco-sensei is really addicted to that moment I think I enjoyed it a little. It wasn't a reaction to really hit.

575
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:15,090
It's possible that you'll be happy to sleep overnight and stay calm. I hope you enjoy it.

576
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:30,217
By the way, this is what Micra did with Choco-sensei for a while, and it looks like that today, but I think I'll do this next time, because from 19:00 today, that song frame I'm planning to do that, so everyone.

577
00:05:30,217 --> 00:05:45,094
A woman who doesn't make a voice.

578
00:05:45,094 --> 00:06:00,239
I'd like to do Micra from 23:00 after I went to the main, so if that Masako doesn't have a long time, I'll choose it there because I can read the long leotard and that a little earlier time slowly. Right. I have a lot. Thank you so much for chatting.

579
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:15,201
Eva Ota I talked to you, but please listen again. Thank you. I'm sorry I took a day off yesterday because I wasn't feeling well.
