1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:00,133
Everyone is a blank fox.

2
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:15,090
Some at home. You can see it seriously.

3
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:30,125
It rusted slowly. Christie Tene no Yu. The human being seen.

4
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:45,111
I would be very happy if you could see it in the window. Today's baby's. Please see the delivery.

5
00:02:45,111 --> 00:03:00,116
I'm watching Japan. diary.

6
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:15,137
One by one Talk deck. Even so, the talk history is prepared. 8 I wonder where it is.

7
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:30,138
Shall we go? Takoyaki House in Tottori.

8
00:03:30,138 --> 00:03:45,106
It is an impression of the tournament. Hey Abeno The tournament is over.

9
00:03:45,106 --> 00:04:00,147
As a result of collecting money and totaling various points such as Takatsuki's points, the total is 20.

10
00:04:00,147 --> 00:04:15,152
The witch doesn't have any prizes, though.

11
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:30,128
That Avex practice weather is just a little bit before. Forgive me. Please forgive me because I wanted to practice.

12
00:04:30,128 --> 00:04:45,160
Was it interesting with the meteorite? I want to go to gold diamonds, but it's strange again.

13
00:04:45,160 --> 00:05:00,085
If you can go, it's dangerous. Custom match is insanely fun.

14
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:15,102
It was, though. Loose and custom.

15
00:05:15,102 --> 00:05:30,147
The practice that was so much fun was custom from 21:00 to 24:00. Oh yeah yeah yeah At first I was invited by another person.

16
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:45,197
I was in a pinch, but later on, Roboco-san invited me.

17
00:05:45,197 --> 00:06:00,109
Besides, I would like to participate with Tora-chan, who is worried about the outer box.

18
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:15,139
PS I have to do my best I want to do my best because it's fun.

19
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:30,174
Although I want to do my best, I have a lot of games I want to play, but from February I will restart with Death Stranding. I think we can do it slowly from around noon. Why live in February.

20
00:06:30,174 --> 00:06:45,136
Oh yeah yeah yeah. I've already eaten. You can relax, actually.

21
00:06:45,136 --> 00:07:00,175
It seems that I can't get it. 3 If you want to go for a long time, I'd like to enter about 2 hours, but that's right.

22
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:15,172
Naruto hears that Leakatsu Resort can take time. That's right.

23
00:07:15,172 --> 00:07:30,108
I think I can do it with a start and a margin, so make a note of what I want to do.

24
00:07:30,108 --> 00:07:45,106
After all there was no errand. It was a tournament with Sumitomo.

25
00:07:45,106 --> 00:08:00,153
Even in Mirage. So myself too.

26
00:08:00,153 --> 00:08:15,103
In terms of composition, the clerical staff can protect it by doing something like a dome.

27
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:30,150
I want to play at the tournament. If it's beets, the house is also good. He told me to have fun.

28
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:45,155
Because I said that, it's about time for the empty box senior to be good as it is. I was very happy.

29
00:08:45,155 --> 00:09:00,130
Use your favorite character with your dad's favorite character.

30
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:15,115
It was there. He uses it a lot.

31
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:30,098
Thank you Wiener for being so funny.

32
00:09:30,098 --> 00:09:45,142
I wondered if it would work, so in Koharu-chan, everyone, everyone. It was fun.

33
00:09:45,142 --> 00:10:00,122
Was funny. Look at the cheongsam and say that I should try using Mirage.

34
00:10:00,122 --> 00:10:15,138
The year I was sucked in by the butterfly was really interesting.

35
00:10:15,138 --> 00:10:30,138
In the thank-you tournament, the one who became the most ra was inside the 3 buildings. That was really hit. Big writer.

36
00:10:30,138 --> 00:10:45,150
It's a big house with glasses. But it's too funny and grass.

37
00:10:45,150 --> 00:11:00,123
I was thinking of following them all together, but something is amazing.

38
00:11:00,123 --> 00:11:15,139
I felt that. But it's really fun. Very neat, Mio.

39
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:30,128
I gave it to my brother. When I was caring for Hapi-chan's food, it was really fun, and I knocked it down.

40
00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:45,137
And thank you everyone. I think I was talking, but it hurts again.

41
00:11:45,137 --> 00:12:00,126
So I think it's a question that everyone melts a little. that. 8 Mirage in the story of the after-night festival.

42
00:12:00,126 --> 00:12:15,109
I'm very happy that everyone is saying it.

43
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:30,212
I couldn't put it in, but the delusional Rina-chan was amazing, saying that she wasn't Uncle Miller. It's an exchange like that was good, isn't it?

44
00:12:30,212 --> 00:12:45,114
I was very happy. I wonder what it is that shouldn't be damaged.

45
00:12:45,114 --> 00:13:00,167
You can't buy it on the day, wasn't it? It was so cute.

46
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:15,142
Trident Shiina was also insanely interesting.

47
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:30,179
If you know, Trident Sheila in the middle of the wedding.

48
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:45,123
The binding that I couldn't go to the company was really interesting. I wonder if jal Sky has fallen.

49
00:13:45,123 --> 00:14:00,133
Katori Senior. I hit and hit and sent something like 2.

50
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:15,158
I wonder who it was after all.

51
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:30,152
Is it before?

52
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:45,167
It was when Shizuka-chan said that it wasn't a festival, but that it was crazy.

53
00:14:45,167 --> 00:15:00,113
Then, after that, the phone was in the comment. It was.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,117
I made a little of that.

55
00:00:15,117 --> 00:00:30,095
Ah, this, this, this, this.

56
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:45,157
That festival is catching a clapperboard. Matsuri-chan too.

57
00:00:45,157 --> 00:01:00,120
It was a shipping fee after it was glorious.

58
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:15,106
Ya-chan was cute.

59
00:01:15,106 --> 00:01:30,149
Why did Suzuki buy two of the feces for Matsuri-chan? I was fanned by using Mirage.

60
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:45,146
It settled down. 7 mm length. Mirror I'm glad you defended Mirror.

61
00:01:45,146 --> 00:02:00,176
It was. I was happy, popular in the Milan era.

62
00:02:00,176 --> 00:02:15,131
Exercise is very angry.

63
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:45,168
Fireworks display on the eve of the festival. It was super interesting, wasn't it? Eva Aircraft Fist 5.

64
00:02:45,168 --> 00:03:00,114
Take a look at the cutout of the fallen mom.

65
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:15,132
please look. I'm glad there. I wanted to fight with my fist.

66
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:30,131
I didn't have it, but I lent it, but it's really fun, so Nakata again.

67
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:45,177
I think. I wish I could get the practice broadcast earlier, but in the bath.

68
00:03:45,177 --> 00:04:00,135
It's a little difficult to gather members. It's a little horror to gather members.

69
00:04:00,135 --> 00:04:15,131
fore RISE.

70
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:30,167
The second broadcast of the distant Akanka Hall will be available, so please join us tomorrow. You're wondering when the Hololive Live Ball can be restarted.

71
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:45,115
Let's make a private match together Even though it's a listener participation. It was an impression of the tournament.

72
00:04:45,115 --> 00:05:15,124
Hi, I'm going back a bit to the past. It was the day of the cinema eve, but there was a Mahoro match that day, Shirakami Doto Expressway.

73
00:05:15,124 --> 00:05:30,169
I'll talk to you for about 4 hours from 3 o'clock and then hand it over.

74
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:45,160
Kihen Note is dead. Thank you very much.

75
00:05:45,160 --> 00:06:00,116
Kitakata's name is also posted, so it stands 120. It is a model of about 120 people.

76
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:15,153
You can talk on that Amazon, because I talked for 20 minutes in a row.

77
00:06:15,153 --> 00:06:30,117
It was late, but there are about 126 to 120 people. That's for everyone to sit down. The moment I sat down on an occasional chair because what I was there disappeared.

78
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:45,138
thought. Both 1st and 2nd copies.

79
00:06:45,138 --> 00:07:00,119
Some of them say that the last person has come and can do it twice again.

80
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:15,140
Western goods are listeners.

81
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:30,129
I've seen it in my name. This person has an icon and a business card on his face. Doing LINE, the icon set with this does not appear.

82
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:45,179
Most of the people who comment in German are names. I have a similar name, but I think he's already this person.

83
00:07:45,179 --> 00:08:00,141
It was a lot of fun. I wonder if he knows one-sidedly.

84
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:15,092
The man I wanted to talk about as it is. Those two costumes still hurt.

85
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:30,121
Tomorrow's mom's strongest. There are people who say that, too, this is it.

86
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:45,128
I want to see erotic.

87
00:08:45,128 --> 00:09:00,166
Trio Some people asked me if I couldn't talk, so I ended up with the last button.

88
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:15,178
There were two people wearing Bibi hats. It was the first time I came back.

89
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:30,133
I spilled it because I was talking or everyone was wearing it. I have no choice but to remember, so I can't see my face with the mask at all.

90
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:45,125
It's true that you have ears.

91
00:09:45,125 --> 00:10:00,139
You grinned that there were two people wearing Billy's hat. Some people say they are watching. There is one more.

92
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:15,117
Everyone came.

93
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:30,197
Work in an aquarium. You're here, right? I'd like to tell you that I'm working safely at that aquarium.

94
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:45,194
There is so, as it is in the form of congratulations. The meaning of the competitors has changed, so it was different during the day. Yes.

95
00:10:45,194 --> 00:11:00,169
Mari-chan's hair The green hair is a memo creature that I remember by myself with Roronoa Zorosan.

96
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:15,148
There is a person who is sick, and in a cool way with green hair.

97
00:11:15,148 --> 00:11:30,155
Tomica It seems that the battle is lined up at a glance because of the beautiful green. surprised.

98
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:45,131
You brought your weapon. How to write a blank page of the chat festival.

99
00:11:45,131 --> 00:12:00,146
Also, when I had the opportunity to chat with a woman playing with everyone, that blank handwritten vacant house. It will be hot tomorrow, turn it on. I can do it because there is only a little.

100
00:12:00,146 --> 00:12:15,153
It feels like it's not difficult, so I'm a little confused about how to write the kanji for that movie.

101
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:30,164
Experienced fans also really did the early initialization 2 Did they go to that discrimination? That's really amazing. Thank you. I knew that he was dissecting me when I was afraid.

102
00:12:30,164 --> 00:12:45,145
There are also people who say that the reason they learned about that live was from a blank sheet of paper.

103
00:12:45,145 --> 00:13:00,180
On Twitter, everyone's live broadcast, see this and retweet. There are many people who stand in Ako City, but that's what I did because I really want swans to do the same.

104
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:15,130
most. I want to love everyone so that they can be married.

105
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:30,112
Those who have retweeted a lot of everyone's broadcasts and said that they are doing it now, but what did they say behind the scenes?

106
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:45,143
It was a moment when I thought it was really good to continue. Did you say that was a little rewarding?

107
00:13:45,143 --> 00:14:00,150
It is highly evaluated if you can get your impressions together. I want to go Yes Thank you.

108
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:15,135
After that, it was good that Northern Cross was the first to play as a human being.

109
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:30,122
Those who came I'm thin. I brought my one-year-old daughter and this heart hurts. Hologram to a cute 2-year-old child.

110
00:14:30,122 --> 00:14:45,119
You are a Tsum Tsum lady.

111
00:14:45,119 --> 00:15:00,169
However, it seems that Joypolis has come with your family, and now my wife is looking at my child, and I'm a little grinning. I wonder if Nakatsu is a kind family with a great grin.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,143
I don't like it if I say that I'm interested in one hobby diary.

113
00:00:15,143 --> 00:00:30,171
I asked him to show me his ideal home with a blank sheet of paper.

114
00:00:30,171 --> 00:00:45,153
For moms who want to bring them there as well. I thought it was a great family to say that they would help me, so please take good care of me.

115
00:00:45,153 --> 00:01:15,177
At the time of the story, I went to an off-party in Osaka or a little more stream to see it locally, and then Otosaka. When I was there for 2 hours. Speaking of which, at a local event.

116
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:30,132
I was so happy to hear that, so I grinned.

117
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:45,124
I'm not coming, but if everyone can come back, I'll follow him for a while, so I talked there and they became friends. I like anime.

118
00:01:45,124 --> 00:02:00,143
I think real events are important.

119
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:15,188
After all, the opportunity to make friends at home is such a real event. It was supposed to be, after all it starts from there.

120
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:30,146
I hope the day will come when I can put in a lot.

121
00:02:30,146 --> 00:02:45,239
Then there is no one who will make a box with a blank sheet later. Tomorrow I was alone. It hurt, I wish I had Popo-chan, but it's a delusion.

122
00:02:45,239 --> 00:03:00,119
Oh yeah yeah so why?

123
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:15,169
It's hard to find it. It's the culture of female otaku in the prime bra.

124
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:30,127
The woman who makes expensive cigarettes. Foresta's female listener often said that it was a bag, a cut, and a celebration.

125
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:45,139
A blank sheet of paper just before I thought I wasn't here. I'm so happy that you can follow me on how to check the altar.

126
00:03:45,139 --> 00:04:00,107
It's a culture only for otaku girls.

127
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:15,182
I'm an aunt, but I'm the same character. You collect 20 and 30 pieces. If you get one of your own stars, it's OK. 2 combos.

128
00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:30,162
I don't have to go. I don't like it.

129
00:04:30,162 --> 00:04:45,126
But this is the only one I want. Geek girls are so yeah yeah yeah yeah.

130
00:04:45,126 --> 00:05:00,130
I'm an otaku girl. A nerdy girl who can buy all the goods from.

131
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:15,198
I think it's an otaku girl who is in great demand. Yes Yes Yes. It's a culture, so I don't have the image of buying the same goods in such a large quantity.

132
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:30,107
I've seen a blank sheet of paper on the putt, riding with that nerdy boy and nerd girl.

133
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:45,136
Geek girls are masturbation goods For the time being, any one with the same pattern. Because I thought, that blank paper too.

134
00:05:45,136 --> 00:06:00,133
I think I'll drink it, but I don't know. I haven't made it until I got him, but it's still a marble.

135
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:15,118
Even the same one has 3 inside. Oh yeah yeah yeah.

136
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:30,133
I wonder what happened, but you're a nerd. Preservation For missionary use For ornamental use Ornamental use Interference with watching Kansai It's like youkai 14. He said that he was very happy that it rained.

137
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:45,146
Some people said they fell into the swamp of the game, so thank you. The current trial version is on the Colonia broadcast, isn't it?

138
00:06:45,146 --> 00:07:00,107
You're doing it right now in Osumi.

139
00:07:00,107 --> 00:07:15,120
Even if there is someone who writes it, it's messed up. thank you very much. I'll give it here. It seems so.

140
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:30,134
I'm thinking of opening it to melon soda, so that. To you.

141
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:45,152
After seeing Far From Home, tell me to see Sharknado.

142
00:07:45,152 --> 00:08:00,121
After seeing From Home after the end of the next year, that. The rest is that Gojo Satoru.

143
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:15,161
I got a look at it, so I went to bed because I got it from the back, but I thought it was dry.

144
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:30,154
The usual broadcast members say that people overfished that shark stuffed animal. Mr. Ishi from Minoo City, Osaka is the name below.

145
00:08:30,154 --> 00:08:45,162
I will do it. It's very difficult for some people to see it so much.

146
00:08:45,162 --> 00:09:00,137
There are cheaper ones.

147
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:15,166
You're here, but are you already? Come on. Thank you, even though I think it's true.

148
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:30,125
It's out on Friday. Somehow famous that you can put in guests on this side.

149
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:45,188
Yes Yes Yes. But I'm so happy that he told me I'll do my best to get out of it.

150
00:09:45,188 --> 00:10:00,144
It was a really good voice. Ai Hoshina.

151
00:10:00,144 --> 00:10:15,160
There is a person who praises the blank slate with a soggy voice on the phone at home with a cool voice. Some people recommend it.

152
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:30,132
I wondered if I should sneak a toy toy toy toy.

153
00:10:30,132 --> 00:10:45,156
There was also a request for those who really like unreasonableness and who are foolish, to mess up more. I'm going to make more and more sounds for the first time in a row.

154
00:10:45,156 --> 00:11:00,154
I heard Kuro-chan is also in the Cabinet position.

155
00:11:00,154 --> 00:11:15,153
It came out. Tie The story that the white rust cat also has the shape of a tie and the shape of the tie.

156
00:11:15,153 --> 00:11:45,138
This is an opportunity for people to talk to these listeners.

157
00:11:45,138 --> 00:12:00,169
If you have any, please look forward to it. Thank you. I wanted to talk more to Aoi General three-color nutrition.

158
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:15,153
Is this all right. It will end soon in the afternoon, but don't forget.

159
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:30,112
It's a stuffed animal of Utsunomiya goods.

160
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:45,162
I was hoping it wasn't slippery, though I didn't see Jane-chan.

161
00:12:45,162 --> 00:13:00,203
The fact that the stuffed animal was projected is just a lie and a decoration. thank you very much.

162
00:13:00,203 --> 00:13:15,117
I'm attached to the stuffed animal, so please wait a moment. What do you mean.

163
00:13:15,117 --> 00:13:30,099
Shirakami's dream space I want you to see this Look at this, look.

164
00:13:30,099 --> 00:14:00,108
Jade on the left Jade's stuffed animal was somehow taken away by Leo. Only the salad Jade is gone.

165
00:14:00,108 --> 00:14:15,136
I have to find them all. I brought me. Ryosuke on both sides is sandwiched between two.

166
00:14:15,136 --> 00:14:30,158
It's a tiny right to understand that. I want to line up more and more, but the same one.

167
00:14:30,158 --> 00:14:45,157
I heard that he was 15 years old, so I added some color. All you have to do is take a quick look.

168
00:14:45,157 --> 00:15:00,131
Hey, I wonder if I like it because it's a size that's easy to hold on the road. We are here. I have a plan.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,120
I hang a can badge on the wall of an anime house, but I don't think it's a drama story.

170
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:30,174
Since the metal charm has arrived, I think it should be displayed somewhere that has healed.

171
00:00:30,174 --> 00:00:45,070
Decorate more goods. It's too erotic.

172
00:00:45,070 --> 00:01:00,158
I've talked a lot, so I think it's over quickly, but what about the Avengers?

173
00:01:00,158 --> 00:01:15,107
Teke ... I have a feeling that I want to finish it quickly.

174
00:01:15,107 --> 00:01:30,172
The Avengers I thought so, I didn't know it, so it seems like a blank slate, so if you look at Twitter.

175
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:45,157
Likely to go. It's dirty, well, I just saw the Avengers like that.

176
00:01:45,157 --> 00:02:00,146
I don't know how cute it is, but tell me very much.

177
00:02:00,146 --> 00:02:15,160
Let's talk about Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Cap. I know the Avengers Loki is cute, but it's Thor. When I see it later, the eggs are cute.

178
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:30,137
It's like what you're doing.

179
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:45,108
Hatori I'm wondering if it's Reika. The erection after seeing that battle royale on the network is so yeah yeah yeah.

180
00:02:45,108 --> 00:03:00,111
When I was sick. I understand the meaning of that scene at that time.

181
00:03:00,111 --> 00:03:15,161
That older sister How to catch the Hulk. The surprise is also cute. Siri.

182
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:30,136
At the very end, the savior of Toride is supposed to have come, so it's cute.

183
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:45,116
Battle royale is the cutest if you do it. battle. Neutrons have arrived.

184
00:03:45,116 --> 00:04:00,137
But die. It's cute, isn't it? Arock Sanwa.

185
00:04:00,137 --> 00:04:15,160
When I see the very first Mighty Thor, it's a sword. It's amazing that you were said to be a surfer, isn't it?

186
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:30,138
After seeing the piece, I feel that the problem and this sharp muscle are different. I'm the strongest. I think I'm the strongest.

187
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:45,098
26-chan Orange and everyone that cute.

188
00:04:45,098 --> 00:05:00,198
I feel that the sound relationship between Camp and Iron Man is precious, but Marin is an avenger. Is it white that I thought it was marine?

189
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:15,140
I thought, so when I first saw the Avengers. Risa is from there. Read aloud.

190
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:30,154
I feel these two people feel that pixiv is worth fishing, but at the same time, what should I do like Guts and Griffith? It was done.

191
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:45,140
It's like Miona who made a mistake.

192
00:05:45,140 --> 00:06:00,130
Study like that. It's just stained in Odawara.

193
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:15,128
I feel like I really want you to go to Civil War. In other words, I want you to see if Nchan is a good girl to watch in Kimura when you can relax and watch the movie at the same time.

194
00:06:15,128 --> 00:06:30,136
It's great, look it up in Civil War. at the time.

195
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:45,101
Ultraman is a little cute. I wonder if it's torn, like dentures.

196
00:06:45,101 --> 00:07:00,135
I think it's because I'm flirting with Supreme Blues. Blue and flirting.

197
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:15,143
Then it can't be helped. Kyoyama That's what I did to protect it, but that's it.

198
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:45,115
It's dangerous to think that it has become. Really. I have a lot of feelings about this.

199
00:07:45,115 --> 00:08:00,104
I want to take it.

200
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:15,147
I really like the photo of Tony Stark. Toilet grouping Until now. I wonder which one you like a little Iron Man 7 Iron Man Is it a cap?

205
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:30,090
That's exactly what you see. Sumiyoshi.

206
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:45,081
Deadpool for two kids. Lawson will appear in the neighborhood.

207
00:09:45,081 --> 00:10:00,120
I'm not fishing because I'm fighting for bad guys, but I'm cute. Isn't it?

208
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:15,167
Isn't Deadpool Doujinshi a little bad? that.

209
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:30,134
Because it's a little too much. that.

210
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:45,159
Even if the movie expression and equipment come to see only the testimony face. But I really like it. I can forgive it because it's this.

211
00:10:45,159 --> 00:11:00,122
Is it a permissible expression? That's why it's fun.

212
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:15,088
Hey, it's really amazing. The style is also very good. It 's not good, that 's it.

213
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:30,182
The feeling is amazing. I hope you will be happy again. The store you are currently in.

214
00:11:30,182 --> 00:11:45,111
Wait a minute to write. Really really. It's fun.

215
00:11:45,111 --> 00:12:00,130
Bergamo Grape that you want to watch at the same time. thought. I just bought and sold something. I wonder if something was stolen.

216
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:15,110
Because I love. You love it, right? Anyone is fine. Choshi fog.

217
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:30,080
Himeji bomb recommended.

218
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:45,153
I have a cough when I sleep. Even with Chiba cosmetics, I think I'll dubb it on the air.

219
00:12:45,153 --> 00:13:00,130
The best there. Abe is really the best Venom voice.

220
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:15,162
Each one is really decent. Kawada: The voice of the suicide bomber has more impressions than the voice of the dubbed voice.

221
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:30,085
How about putting it in?

222
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:45,107
I violently agreed with him. I have a very low voice, though.

223
00:13:45,107 --> 00:14:00,036
It's so cute.

224
00:14:00,036 --> 00:14:15,098
A model that just takes on the equipment combined with the awakening.

225
00:14:15,098 --> 00:14:30,135
I'm talking about coming. Taken in wild and forced with Venom.

226
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:45,138
Until it's called Ellie Block. That person is a free reporter. A person called E-block.

227
00:14:45,138 --> 00:15:00,135
If you drink outside, you will meet. The sound of that time.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,164
Those who understand how to use Gutch Yuzo's Eleve. But we also came to invade the earth.

229
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:45,182
I'm an alien, though. The same is true for Venoms. Ams spoilers 2.

230
00:00:45,182 --> 00:01:00,108
Still already. Among them.

231
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:15,142
It's like being called a losing dog. Oh yeah yeah yeah it seems that I was invited and I really liked people.

232
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:30,110
I will fight. I can solve it if Friday.

233
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:45,152
It's so cute, isn't it? I thought I'd do my best, but it seems like I changed my mind.

234
00:01:45,152 --> 00:02:00,115
Let's all eat the voice of Belo.

235
00:02:00,115 --> 00:02:15,111
Let's put the Far From Homepage level next and put in Sharknado. Looking for people who want to meet in a hurry.

236
00:02:15,111 --> 00:02:30,179
No, I really came in at the very end of that Venom and that number one.

237
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:45,174
Whatever it was at ANA, after the end roll was over, there was a scene in May, and one in three household accounts on the phone. If you think you've seen it, that's it, that's it.

238
00:02:45,174 --> 00:03:00,123
The magic one too. Title of work I can't remember.

239
00:03:00,123 --> 00:03:15,138
Whatever the group genius genius genius genius and grand illusion. I wondered what I wanted to do, and even if I had Grand Illusions 1 and 2, both works were messed up.

240
00:03:15,138 --> 00:03:30,102
The members who are good at it are suddenly gathered and robbed. Whatever the story, this is true.

241
00:03:30,102 --> 00:03:45,122
Actor Where is the last of the dance Venom?

242
00:03:45,122 --> 00:04:00,160
I talked a lot too much Grand Illusion South 4. minion.

243
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:15,144
If you take it when canceling the transmission, it will be over there. I took too much.

244
00:04:15,144 --> 00:04:30,136
Have Morgan Freeman stay.

245
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:45,143
There are a lot of beautiful things and cool things, so I would appreciate your favor. But it's cute.

246
00:04:45,143 --> 00:05:00,198
I want you to hear the voice of heaven.

247
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:15,129
Because I have the highest love. I'm hungry.

248
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:30,115
I have to bring it.

249
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:45,103
Which one should I choose? I wanted to receive Hatena. Mad Max: Fury Road See everyone.

250
00:05:45,103 --> 00:06:00,101
Everyone runs absent. Cars. Inform-kun.

251
00:06:00,101 --> 00:06:15,164
Run with the blood of the cradle.

252
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:30,128
Let's run it later. It's really funny today, though.

253
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:45,140
I want to talk about the Avengers tomorrow, but I have an adventure in Akasaka.

254
00:06:45,140 --> 00:07:00,103
Isn't it?

255
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:15,089
I want goods. I thought I wanted it, Ikebukuro is decent.

256
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:30,139
He holds one hand in front of God and looks at me and laughs.

257
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:45,129
The Infinity Gauntlet is terrible at ATMs this year. Maybe it has a gauntlet, I'm scared, right now I've received a little present.

258
00:07:45,129 --> 00:08:00,134
I'd like you to send me a letter by all means, but during the gift acceptance period, this year's dangerous 2021 castle.

259
00:08:00,134 --> 00:08:15,123
Sent on the net. I sent a letter by phone anytime. I am looking for a letter. Thank you.

260
00:08:15,123 --> 00:08:30,131
I have one, but I want to send a present cantlet.

261
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:45,132
It's like an option. Now, let's do it now, everyone who might have this hand as a gauntlet.

262
00:08:45,132 --> 00:09:00,096
Gauntlet.

263
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:15,145
If I take a finger patch, I wonder if I can patch it.

264
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:30,146
I don't need a helmet.

265
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:45,153
I want a big house. It's like a nut, but I think it was a name like that.

266
00:09:45,153 --> 00:10:00,120
You're inside, I want a time stone.

267
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:15,130
It seems that it is useless with + Amazon in the transfer. The blank paper is also inherited.

268
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:30,141
Like Spider-Man's suit. Everyone who may be.

269
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:45,111
What will happen if something happens? It's like a suit.

270
00:10:45,111 --> 00:11:15,167
That's it. Doctor 2 barrage Mikkelsen Doctor Strange Very cool nail clippers It's good because there are 3 stars.

271
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:30,059
nice to meet you. Mione. Mione.

272
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:45,146
I'm waiting because I screamed the moment I first came out, not just looking at it.

273
00:11:45,146 --> 00:12:00,158
I wonder if there is anything else to talk about, The Avengers.

274
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:15,148
After seeing everything from Haruma to Captain Marvel, I left it in Endgame. Four days to gay.

275
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:30,165
John Wick Dubbed Morikawa-san's death John Wick A dog to the extent that everyone can't eat it.

276
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:45,159
Super super super super elite manga of a bad organization The guys of other organizations to the enemy are bumpy. I feel like.

277
00:12:45,159 --> 00:13:00,144
It's a story about a man who kills his dog and destroys the organization. Energy saving seminar.

278
00:13:00,144 --> 00:13:15,114
thumbs up. It 's the best. It is the end.

279
00:13:15,114 --> 00:13:30,125
Jogging seems to be a kanji.

280
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:45,139
But it doesn't matter.

281
00:13:45,139 --> 00:14:00,148
The interesting part of that is that jogging and the director of Deadpool 2.

282
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:15,139
I wonder if it was time + to the director's table at the time of Z 2. It's the expression of the one who killed the dog. That's what the Eagles director introduced to the guy who killed the dog at John Wick.

283
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:30,125
It comes in 3. Was it 1 and 2? I wonder if it was introduced and credit.

284
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:45,174
That's about it, and I've been able to put a lot of things into the cast. Black joke on parade What a bargain sale and a big parsley.

285
00:14:45,174 --> 00:15:00,160
A blank sheet of paper at the pool is a little impossible.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,110
There seems to be a deadpool when it was a blank slate. It seems likely.

287
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:30,112
That's why I took a blank sheet of paper. It may be cute.

288
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:45,085
Always like the array. It was the 120th part.

289
00:00:45,085 --> 00:01:00,119
Ion Happiness.

290
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:15,100
I really like mobiles The Avengers I really like it. I haven't seen it properly yet, but I would like to see two colors at once.

291
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:30,041
What?

292
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:45,121
Like Batman.

293
00:01:45,121 --> 00:02:00,122
But it was really good.

294
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:15,103
I don't know if it's a pepper. You bought Dewa Butterfly, right? Purification is also the very first. Did you see it in subtitles?

295
00:02:15,103 --> 00:02:30,143
You haven't seen the dark part of The Dark Knight properly. I have a feeling that it is, but it may be because it came out completely if there was a Nico Nico video.

296
00:02:30,143 --> 00:02:45,162
I haven't seen it properly. I've seen Rabbit-kun's guy, so maybe I'm mistaken for that.

297
00:02:45,162 --> 00:03:00,161
There are various things like that. I wanted to see it again, so let's all finish it. 1 hour alarm.

298
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:15,119
I talked a lot Yes Yes. Thank you for being 700,000. Thank you for being 700,000 when everyone arrived.

299
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:30,107
Are you watching so much? Are you there? Thank you very much.

300
00:03:30,107 --> 00:03:45,130
Even though I didn't tweet so much. Thank you for the card Thank you. It gets in the way.

301
00:03:45,130 --> 00:04:00,109
I'm sad that I can't stay officially.

302
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:15,111
I want to be recognized by people. It may be okay to include the recognition of this year's ranch Twitter school. It doesn't stop when you eat it. Cute face of a cat.

303
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:30,054
Thank you as always.

304
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:45,192
But I like it, don't stand in the top, it's fun, thank you, thank you everyone, thank you, everyone. I wanted to talk to you.

305
00:04:45,192 --> 00:05:00,117
After that, there will be a gold relay, so if you like, 2030. Don't miss the pool and bucket.

306
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:15,112
Show your charm.

307
00:05:15,112 --> 00:05:30,106
Asa Chan.
