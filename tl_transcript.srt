1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:12:45,191
Well we are. Yes today.

2
00:12:45,191 --> 00:13:00,135
How to wear like hell. With someone who thought I should do it. Call out to someone who was angry and wondering what to do.

3
00:13:00,135 --> 00:13:15,143
The children got together.

4
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:30,107
I'm thinking of explaining the rules after having them introduce themselves, so I'll go up in order.

5
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:45,041
Yes.

6
00:13:45,041 --> 00:14:15,057
gorilla.

7
00:14:15,057 --> 00:14:30,130
I know it well.

8
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:45,100
Schisandra chinensis.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,099
This is the Amagi store gorilla, also known as the Tenma gorilla.

10
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:45,100
Then next. Is there a way to sit on a banana if I stand up?

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:01:15,160
I want to go to my wife. Then next morning Gori-chan.

12
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:30,154
It's 5 o'clock in the morning. Thank you.

13
00:01:30,154 --> 00:01:45,152
Then singing Gorimi-chan. I'm hoping that it will be thrown in outer space.

14
00:01:45,152 --> 00:02:00,116
Kagura Suzu-chan Good morning.

15
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:15,118
Cartoon. I've never sprayed it.

16
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:30,205
I also practiced sabotage, but since this is my first time online, I might ask him to pull a boy. A typhoon is coming.

17
00:02:30,205 --> 00:02:45,108
You're watching. For projects like hell.

18
00:02:45,108 --> 00:03:15,175
Gorilla-kun Gorilla-chan Welcome back. everyone.

19
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:30,046
Thank you.

20
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:45,128
Today's important and important rules.

21
00:03:45,128 --> 00:04:00,115
More than a head. it's great.

22
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:15,138
This is the rule issued by Zeami.

23
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:30,140
I'm Ell Yes, basically the only words I can speak are on the right side.

24
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:45,186
All the conjunctions are lies, so thank you. When everyone is angry with LINE, I don't know who they are, so I can say my name.

25
00:04:45,186 --> 00:05:00,125
Please note that I cannot say.

26
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:15,117
I used to say shit to Yuki, which means that Yukin's sister is saying now. All colors are red this time.

27
00:05:15,117 --> 00:05:30,153
Yukimi-neechan and red and green were together.

28
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:45,187
And from the beginning, all the places like cafeterias and weapons. I can't say whether it's an event or not.

29
00:05:45,187 --> 00:06:00,147
I can't say any other words with 1, so it's a proper noun such as a weapon.

30
00:06:00,147 --> 00:06:15,115
It's like I was in a weapon.

31
00:06:15,115 --> 00:07:00,074
Who is that area? Because I can't.

32
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:15,123
Who is that area?

33
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:30,143
After taking the difference, it's finished cleaning up.

34
00:07:30,143 --> 00:07:45,148
My task.

35
00:07:45,148 --> 00:08:00,191
Or when you press the middle button.

36
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:15,160
It's okay, though. Gorilla Why is it okay?

37
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:30,113
It 's okay, everyone is Hongo today. I'm pretty suspicious of people tomorrow.

38
00:08:30,113 --> 00:08:45,138
Make me hungry. Let's meet the apps you don't use.

39
00:08:45,138 --> 00:09:00,152
It doesn't matter, but if you say something other than half.

40
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:15,176
If you utter a word other than as an added word. If there were so many coolers.

41
00:09:15,176 --> 00:09:30,093
Have a gorilla put in.

42
00:09:30,093 --> 00:10:00,103
You can speak the key normally.

43
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:15,165
I think it would be really funny to talk, but there are some fat gorillas who are a little hard to talk to.

44
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:45,126
What did you buy that banana, but why was the banana added before that? When everyone likes it.

45
00:10:45,126 --> 00:11:15,146
First of all, 8 The sleeping rules are over.

46
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:45,098

47
00:11:45,098 --> 00:12:00,123
Are you okay today? Yellow-green shirt.

48
00:12:00,123 --> 00:12:30,115
Then 8 Hidden Hidden 10 When it's time to speak normally. Please move properly. Mute the speaker when it starts.

49
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:45,172
If a corpse is found, mute normally. It's okay

50
00:12:45,172 --> 00:13:15,086
Arora again. With everyone. There was.

51
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:30,120

55
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:30,161
No task is finished.

56
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:45,143
Maybe I've never suffered from such a disturbing chat.

57
00:14:45,143 --> 00:15:00,092
Your lyrics.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,082

00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:15,157
Chaos of chaos. I wonder if we are together.

66
00:03:15,157 --> 00:03:30,128

67
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:45,130

It's ridiculous.

72
00:05:30,091 --> 00:06:15,141
Nobody knows anything today.

73
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:45,165
Dangerous profits and methods. How to be orange.

00:08:00,147 --> 00:09:30,168
After killing her. I ran over here with the demon.

79
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:45,127
I think it's food and you may be.

80
00:09:45,127 --> 00:10:00,124
Was strong today.

81
00:10:00,124 --> 00:10:15,152
I wonder if it's difficult to enter digit numbers. I felt like I couldn't make it in time to cure it in a hurry.

82
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:30,144
When you're against it, you'll be alone in outer space.

83
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:45,143
Maybe you're smart. I don't think it works.

84
00:10:45,143 --> 00:11:00,095
Welcome back, Mr. Gorilla.

85
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:15,121

iPhone 2.

87
00:11:45,134 --> 00:12:00,104
It was a place that suddenly opened.

88
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:15,150
Are you with Aisa's Gorimi-chan? I don't think everyone knows.

89
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:30,131
Gorilla rose. I passed by Akaaka. As a red gorilla who passed by.

90
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:45,153
It's a little scary because it overlaps with red and red.

91
00:12:45,153 --> 00:13:00,145
That's why it's done. not a lie. Mitoku.

92
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:15,112

It's the same level as 7th.

00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:30,120
The taskbar has disappeared a little more.

100
00:01:30,120 --> 00:02:00,117

I do not understand. What that child.

104

The spirit world is about to come out. Who did I do? I was killed by Rigori-chan.

109
00:06:45,143 --> 00:07:00,106
It's no good not to be a gorilla.

110
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:15,123
Boston is not old enough to protect himself.

111
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:30,131
I'm a little disappointed I'm losing now.

112
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:45,123
So I didn't become a gorilla with 7. I'm leaving it, isn't it? It's always the case. You might win this game.

113
00:07:45,123 --> 00:08:15,119

thought so.

120
00:10:15,046 --> 00:10:30,097
Yeah, I'm going to sleep again.

121
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:45,112
My sister hasn't attended any gorilla conference right now, why?

122
00:10:45,112 --> 00:11:00,116
I saw Yukimi's sister.

123

00:13:30,118 --> 00:13:45,160
I think it's Yurika, but it's a kanji that somehow catches in-posters.

128
00:13:45,160 --> 00:14:15,132
You're an easy-to-use banana you've already eaten. I was dating because I couldn't speak Japanese.

129
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:30,140
It can not be helped. I'm glad I added it together.

130
00:14:30,140 --> 00:15:00,115
Would you like to go again?

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,102
Look for that sabotage button sabotage. Come out.

132
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:30,128
What is it? There is a cool time and I can't press it.

133
00:00:30,128 --> 00:01:00,138
Sing it to pretend you're doing a task. Thank you.

Freeze and red pin. Together today. Make full use of the power to do with your mobile phone.

140
00:04:45,092 --> 00:05:00,122
There is no fault and most leave without understanding the situation. If I pray, can't I do this one?

141
00:05:00,122 --> 00:05:15,099
Even if I wasn't doing it, I got two when there was nobody, but I couldn't do it.

142
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:30,134
I've been waiting, but there is no such thing. Let's go to a good place. It's really low, isn't it?

143
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:45,076
I'm not saying I'm doing this.

144
00:05:45,076 --> 00:06:00,085
I'm pretending to be carving.

145
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:15,047
What happened.

146
00:06:15,047 --> 00:07:45,152

When you look at it, it looks like before.

152
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:45,147
It's a great hindrance because it can be dyed at the right time.

153
00:09:45,147 --> 00:10:00,102
Did you come out because there are so many?

154
00:10:00,102 --> 00:10:15,104
