00:00:00,000 --> 00:10:45,310
Not available.

8
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:45,048
Right now.

9
00:12:45,048 --> 00:13:00,086
8.

10
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:15,143
Be a professional. Really ugly.

11
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:30,042
For real. 8.

12
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:45,052

13
00:13:45,052 --> 00:14:00,137
Subscriber. this is.

14
00:14:00,137 --> 00:14:15,044
Is it not?

15
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:30,144
Thankfully, it was delivered in 3 yesterday. Thank you very much.

16
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:45,118
Thank you very much. When I woke up in the morning.

17
00:14:45,118 --> 00:15:00,156
later, OK. I wonder if it will be during this delivery soon.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,152
From 7:30. But it starts from 30 minutes.

19
00:00:15,152 --> 00:00:30,115
I may go there soon. Isn't it used in the middle of the relay wiring?

20
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:45,101
I'm glad if you tell me. You haven't decided whether to make it.

21
00:00:45,101 --> 00:01:00,091
What shall I make today? Oh dear. I'm wondering if I should make something in the Riisa Naka course.

22
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:15,110
But I haven't. Ready for Micra. What can I make?

23
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:30,125
What should i make I want you to make a cafe in 30 minutes.

24
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:45,126
It's 30 minutes.

25
00:01:45,126 --> 00:02:00,145
So I decided that I could really make this. I can't.

26
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:15,164
I've never seen it because I'm tired, not a zombie. It's okay to prepare or something like that.

27
00:02:15,164 --> 00:02:45,187
The time has been extended.

28
00:02:45,187 --> 00:03:00,104
I feel like it feels like it.

29
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:15,104
Bakantoko. What should I do? For the time being, part 9.

30
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:30,119
I really thought I should do it when it was abolished. I'm going to talk about today.

31
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:45,145
3D delivery yesterday Some of you have seen it.

32
00:03:45,145 --> 00:04:00,150
That's Kirameki Rider's.

33
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:15,180
It's amazing, you went to the last minute. When practicing dance.

34
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:30,125
Right. Powder at the base of the nail. You hurt me.

35
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:45,123
I had to choose either loose shoes or fairly tight shoes.

36
00:04:45,123 --> 00:05:00,108
You bought it and asked the teacher, so it's a little derived from that little dance. You were told that that fox was better.

37
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:15,138
At the base of the nail The base of the thumb of the nail hurts so much. That bad shit.

38
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:30,138
I got out and cried inside. I hurt the base of my thumb.

39
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:45,123
It was still good.

40
00:05:45,123 --> 00:06:00,171
Go to the kitchen to eat normally. It looks like something was caught in between.

41
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:15,090
Of the thumb. I'm sure Santa.

42
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:30,135
What if you think you're in terrible pain? The whole thing is purple. With your thumb.

43
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:45,143
I don't know if I kissed you. Anyway, just walking my thumb doesn't hurt. I'm thinking of freezing the refrigerator.

44
00:06:45,143 --> 00:07:00,109
The woman who thinks it's a nail.

45
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:15,126
That peeled off and ended early.

46
00:07:15,126 --> 00:07:30,126
Imagine what to do. It will be unveiled tomorrow. Good luck.

47
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:45,101
I thought there was only one.

48
00:07:45,101 --> 00:08:00,145
But my body didn't hurt at all-it didn't hurt at all until the delivery was over. It suddenly started to hurt.

49
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:15,170
What is it? Ritsuko Tanaka Adrenaline is out. Fall down until the end.

50
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:30,116
Now now. I'm thinking of going to the hospital.

51
00:08:30,116 --> 00:08:45,111
That's right, my thumb hurt a lot.

52
00:08:45,111 --> 00:09:00,145
I did my best, but that Kirameki Rider. I remember.

53
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:15,151
Official list I definitely wanted to remember it.

54
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:30,102
Lake Inaga.

55
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:45,114
Where to do.

56
00:09:45,114 --> 00:10:00,127
Which foot should you put out and which hand should you put out? Looking back now.

57
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:15,140
That that.

58
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:30,127
That official choreography. Watch the video. So I can't even ask.

59
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:45,128
Divided into those 3 patterns. Even if it says, money is this.

60
00:10:45,128 --> 00:11:00,124
It 's a dance, is n't it? timer. You're doing it today, you mixed it all.

61
00:11:00,124 --> 00:11:15,141
I've been singing all the time, so I went to the part of the person who was singing all the time. There is also a clock.

62
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:30,139
Who should I ask? You mixed it all.

63
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:45,097
I remember.

64
00:11:45,097 --> 00:12:00,159
Even if I'm in the way of synchronizing and sweating. Somehow. Please.

65
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:15,146
I asked him to show the video on that monitor for a moment.

66
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:30,143
While watching that one occasionally. I was impressed and it might have been late.

67
00:12:30,143 --> 00:12:45,104
But you know. I did my best to surf.

68
00:12:45,104 --> 00:13:00,126
It didn't hurt while I was doing my legs.

69
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:15,073
I thought it was good.

70
00:13:15,073 --> 00:13:30,118
A cosmo-like lake-like place.

71
00:13:30,118 --> 00:13:45,111
Great satisfaction.

72
00:13:45,111 --> 00:14:00,200
SAO. It's so beautiful.

73
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:15,082
It feels like I can go. Yuno Lake.

74
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:30,174
Something moment on the way. Really between songs.

75
00:14:30,174 --> 00:14:45,128
That's true.

76
00:14:45,128 --> 00:15:00,114
Isn't it? There is a flash of light in between.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,069
It's hard not to come. Surprise me.

78
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:30,104
Arione is surprised.

79
00:00:30,104 --> 00:00:45,122
10 episodes of the second song, Boya's dream. Lullaby.

80
00:00:45,122 --> 00:01:00,101
So I put Daifuku on my lap. Moreover, it was put on my lap. I thought it was good.

81
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:15,162
It was good there. Aso Subaru was too expensive. That lullaby.

82
00:01:15,162 --> 00:01:30,136
After that. Second grade song. It was Katakana who was a dream man.

83
00:01:30,136 --> 00:01:45,143
What is Coronel's song?

84
00:01:45,143 --> 00:02:00,087
The one I heard earlier.

85
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:15,151
That's familiar to me, I sang it earlier.

86
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:30,157
If you ask me again, you may think that it is true. That second song. I wanted to be Kaminoseki.

87
00:02:30,157 --> 00:02:45,154
I couldn't make it on the train. A book about playing.

88
00:02:45,154 --> 00:03:00,132
By the way. You can open it with a video.

89
00:03:00,132 --> 00:03:15,127
I will publish that. I'm happy.

90
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:30,095
Did I think of tears?

91
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:45,140
I didn't really come. Hiroto just took a picture.

92
00:03:45,140 --> 00:04:00,126
Are you serious?

93
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:15,108
I'm surprised it was officially taken off. Each one.

94
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:45,119
I didn't expect it to be officially taken off. Macho Macho Macho Macho.

95
00:04:45,119 --> 00:05:45,116
It turns white.

96
00:05:45,116 --> 00:06:00,099
Oh yeah I'm an idol declaration. Do you know who that is?

97
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:15,132
I think there are four people. Four.

98
00:06:15,132 --> 00:06:30,101
As of 7 days, everyone will be alone later. I think I heard this quite a bit.

99
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:45,074
Nitori. I was hoping for it.

100
00:06:45,074 --> 00:07:00,141
Maiden Mikochi Hartman Hearing loss. Melty and thick.

101
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:15,125
Please. It's really close to the limit. I asked if I could get a shout.

102
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:30,116
I have that request. But can you get it?

103
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:45,127
In about 10 seconds, a voice came from my senior festival. so. quick.

104
00:07:45,127 --> 00:08:00,148
Something will happen. Alice 59 isn't included.

105
00:08:00,148 --> 00:08:15,153
Normal version. At the angel. Contains the uncle version.

106
00:08:15,153 --> 00:08:30,126
There was a voice in it.

107
00:08:30,126 --> 00:08:45,131
To get used to it. The voice of that part.

108
00:08:45,131 --> 00:09:00,109
Could you give it out?

109
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:15,126
I'm an uncle, but I want to see what to do. It's okay if you come.

110
00:09:15,126 --> 00:09:30,053
yet.

111
00:09:30,053 --> 00:10:00,132
With 2 more. Miatlet.

112
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:15,123
That karaoke sister always make BGM.

113
00:10:15,123 --> 00:10:30,083
At the time of birthday. You didn't really make it.

114
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:45,125
Sing. Hamori.

115
00:10:45,125 --> 00:11:00,120
Do you understand? I was going to put it in.

116
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:15,159
You should say it in your own voice. I think it's good, so why don't you go?

117
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:30,111
Take that hamori's voice by yourself. And that's amazing.

118
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:45,114
I felt like I was really done. I thought it was good.

119
00:11:45,114 --> 00:12:00,148
I had you make it. I put in the chorus myself, so I thought I'd do my best.

120
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:15,083
I had you make it. Work up to masturbation.

121
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:30,102
Really. It doesn't hurt. from the beggining to the end.

122
00:12:30,102 --> 00:12:45,126
Isn't it English?

123
00:12:45,126 --> 00:13:00,139
Even if you look at this with a 3d body and get in touch, it's the first and last. I'm not good at it either. let's do our best.

124
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:15,148
that. Morning routine.

125
00:13:15,148 --> 00:13:30,127
Munakata Even if I woke up, he was excited and excited. I don't have it anymore.

126
00:13:30,127 --> 00:14:00,111
When you sing that, that SNS is Kasumi Risa. Someone come. each.

127
00:14:00,111 --> 00:14:15,137
If you enter slowly and miss it, you won't be able to return. Home appliances for pirate songs.

128
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:30,092
Not too expensive. There are also good points.

129
00:14:30,092 --> 00:14:45,112
SSS is difficult. It's always difficult and difficult I always stopped.

130
00:14:45,112 --> 00:15:00,095
I'm thinking of doing my best in dancing.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,124
It's not about singing, as I said before.

132
00:00:15,124 --> 00:00:30,102
I really bought that lack of sleep ice cream.

133
00:00:30,102 --> 00:01:30,089
It doesn't come on the gorilla management screen.

134
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:45,098
First-class one million spells.

135
00:01:45,098 --> 00:02:15,045
Thank you thank you.

136
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:30,131
I thought I might go to. I didn't think I would go to Iruma today.

137
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:45,074
thank you, thank you, thank you.

138
00:02:45,074 --> 00:03:00,132
Thank you very much thank you very much. It's okay Thank you Thank you.

139
00:03:00,132 --> 00:03:15,130
Thank you very much. 55 people.

140
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:30,135
No, really. Thank you.

141
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:45,096
I don't think such a day will come.

142
00:03:45,096 --> 00:04:00,152
Ah, every day is an anniversary. Thank you. Congratulations for the second consecutive day Thank you. Thank you.

143
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:15,142
Thank you. Congratulations Thank you Thank you.

144
00:04:15,142 --> 00:04:30,146
I have no choice but to drink. I won't drink from now on. Both the house and this are really hot and seniors.

145
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:45,115
From now on, really. Thank you thank you.

146
00:04:45,115 --> 00:05:00,117
I feel like it's really selling right now. That's the only feeling.

147
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:15,115
I haven't drunk alcohol since morning. Yesterday too.

148
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:30,177
The voice in front of me to hear Ueda's voice.

149
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:45,111
For other earphones. Really already.

150
00:05:45,111 --> 00:06:00,116
It 's crazy. That's right.

151
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:15,129
I have a monitor and there are others. I am on the monitor in the middle. Everyone commented.

152
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:30,091
What is the power of comments on a large monitor? Before it starts. While standing in the middle.

153
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:45,125
For a long time, everyone is a rainbow earthquake hole Super Cat.

154
00:06:45,125 --> 00:07:00,161
It's amazing that everyone was there and watching the comments. While watching it, it's amazing, even though my heart is fluttering.

155
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:15,121
You're telling me.

156
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:30,136
When I saw it, my hand was flowing to my sister. I got two about 4 hours ago.

157
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:45,090
Fake flows.

158
00:07:45,090 --> 00:08:00,113
I think everyone will come in.

159
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:15,114
Sagamino Mansion.

160
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:30,128
Like a request. You're a pretty girl, right? A very cute girl.

161
00:08:30,128 --> 00:08:45,085
That together. There are various things.

162
00:08:45,085 --> 00:09:00,132
Someone who likes cutting before the production starts.

163
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:15,110
Secret ambition. Zuttomo goes around from the beginning to the end.

164
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:30,166
He said he had a backache. I have a backache.

165
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:45,081
Will you put the camera on your shoulder and take the set? Thank you for your hard work.

166
00:09:45,081 --> 00:10:00,138
The camera is heavy. Really delusional but really.

167
00:10:00,138 --> 00:10:15,161
Thank you for your previous boyfriend, really 500,000 people Mori-sensei It smells 3 more.

169
00:10:30,101 --> 00:10:45,048

I died lonely there. recommend.

171
00:11:00,123 --> 00:11:15,117
A masturbation pet has two pillows.

172
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:30,115
Usually next to Daifuku sleeping together. I see it when I come to stay.

173
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:45,129
Who said you stepped in the waves? I can only see it now.

174
00:11:45,129 --> 00:12:15,164
I can't see it with a spider at night, so it's a little bit.

175
00:12:15,164 --> 00:12:30,133
Hey hey hey hey I'm an idol step.

176
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:45,127
As expected, I've shaken it too much until now. This is the truth.

177
00:12:45,127 --> 00:13:00,155
There are more cats lined up. You've reached out to the side, so you're out now.

178
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:15,074
I'll do it sideways, right?

179
00:13:15,074 --> 00:13:30,178
later, OK. There were also comments like pills.

180
00:13:30,178 --> 00:13:45,120
Freeze. I'm really sorry that I thought it was a little different from the hospitality. I jumped all the time.

181
00:13:45,120 --> 00:14:00,049
Actually.

182
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:15,134
I was wondering. It's amazing, I remember it. It moves beyond, so cat.

183
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:30,146
This also really works. Later we will work together for 5 shipping. amazing.

184
00:14:30,146 --> 00:14:45,146
I think you understand, but both hands move together.

185
00:14:45,146 --> 00:15:00,097
There are so many choreography around that area. That's how it worked.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,079
In 3D.

187
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:30,111
Not yet, a little my own flame 3. I think I'll feel embarrassed to fall asleep when I get home.

188
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:45,134
I will return it later. For membership only.

189
00:00:45,134 --> 00:01:00,038
Thank you.

190
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:15,131
Send it to me. It's also a 3d video.

191
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:30,148
It finished. The one that comes out today. I was waiting.

192
00:01:30,148 --> 00:01:45,099
After a video called Pokemon. I'm singing an endurance membership for 1 minute.

193
00:01:45,099 --> 00:02:00,189
1 minute naughty while singing a song of Ramigo membership.

194
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:15,131
I took a video. I would like.

195
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:30,154
See also that. Ariga Bicycle was too expensive. A little more calm body.

196
00:02:30,154 --> 00:02:45,153
The point difference is too high. Membership of 1 minute fleet cut.

197
00:02:45,153 --> 00:03:00,133
It could be the song of Infinite Endurance Member Z.

198
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:15,112
Member's button I don't think it's gone for some reason. Lotto 2.

199
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:30,119
It wasn't pee, really. YouTube video because it will be a loop.

200
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:45,118
That's what it is. 3D wheel.

201
00:03:45,118 --> 00:04:00,097

202
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:15,161
Thank you thank you. Make 3DS sleepy. I regret it.

203
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:30,090
How was. The price is where I ran away to an imaginary child.

204
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:45,104
If it's that big, you won't be able to enter the voice. I think I was able to catch both pee and size. How to defeat it is quick.

205
00:04:45,104 --> 00:05:00,098
Around that demon.

206
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:15,092
this. earrings.

207
00:05:15,092 --> 00:05:45,148
somehow. Once as that voice test.

208
00:05:45,148 --> 00:06:00,135
But for the time being, I'll do something like this for that project.

209
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:15,145
But I've always said that it's cheap and like an uncle on the internet.

210
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:30,146
Somehow come a little and at 8. I made Alice's screen visible to everyone, but that much time.

211
00:06:30,146 --> 00:06:45,116
If you're a child It's a girl.

212
00:06:45,116 --> 00:07:15,121
Nene-chan let me take a picture. I wonder what's left.

213
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:30,126
Someone. What is it like?

214
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:45,101
I wish there was something that you could do without any problems.

215
00:07:45,101 --> 00:08:00,100
It seems to be slow. Kamisaka. OK.

216
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:15,147
Can anyone? My uncle's order was amazing. I was out of control.

217
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:30,116
It's not OK.

218
00:08:30,116 --> 00:08:45,123
I don't order anything around that. I was relieved.

219
00:08:45,123 --> 00:09:15,132
Also, I think there was probably something that everyone wanted to see. I think it's ok.

220
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:30,103
Are you interesting? You Nagisa.

221
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:45,153
Eat me. You are really cute.

222
00:09:45,153 --> 00:10:15,115
It's cute. The movie was interesting.

223
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:30,134
Yanaka That's right. After all.

224
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:45,127
He said he didn't sleep much. what. You were also interesting.

225
00:10:45,127 --> 00:11:00,137
I was out of control. next week.

226
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:15,103
Nene-chan. Don't cheat. Everyone was looking forward to it, but I was worried.

227
00:11:15,103 --> 00:11:30,108
Show me. It's cute and cute.

228
00:11:30,108 --> 00:12:00,142
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm really sorry when I make a story When I told anyone, Mel-chan wasn't there.

229
00:12:00,142 --> 00:12:15,135
No, no. You can say it because it's okay. Was funny.

230
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:30,145
I hope you look forward to it.

231
00:12:30,145 --> 00:12:45,134
I'm looking forward to it. Everyone was looking forward to it and there were lots of fun things to do.

232
00:12:45,134 --> 00:13:00,104
A little good news.

233
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:15,143
What is it really? Should I go to the top of my emotions? I'm happy to continue.

234
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:30,087
Of the announcement. I think I can do it.

235
00:13:30,087 --> 00:13:45,126
I'm really sorry for the memo. I was sick when I was from the manager.

236
00:13:45,126 --> 00:14:00,102
I would be happy if you could leave it.

237
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:15,104
Folli Follie. I'm still busy.

238
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:30,165
Even though the manager answered Soma, it's amazing pressure. I was told to report if I went out. About 25 minutes grave.

239
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:45,098
Please report how many autographs you have just signed. Hot in kanji.

240
00:14:45,098 --> 00:15:00,106

This will go a little further. So that's it.

244
00:00:45,118 --> 00:01:00,161
Is it from 7:30 to 30 minutes?

245
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:30,129
With a clock. E-mail radio waves from 8 o'clock.

246
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:45,111
I haven't thought about what to make yet.

247
00:01:45,111 --> 00:02:00,172
I want to plant it when I want to detain and seagulls. I want to grow coffee around it and make it break.

248
00:02:00,172 --> 00:02:15,125
Service overtime too. I want to do industry. Lastly.

249
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:30,111
Make a note. Umeda Hana special ice cube.

250

Is it until March 1st?

252
00:03:00,122 --> 00:03:15,117
But actually, I have an acrylic stand at hand. I wanted to lick it. Or maybe.

253
00:03:15,117 --> 00:03:30,111
9 more.

254
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:45,194
Put it with ice cubes and ice when you drink alcohol. It feels just right because it is used together with.

00:03:45,194 --> 00:04:15,104
Because it's small. Even if you don't buy it.

256
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:30,160
Heavenly voice of tennis to Jizo. With ice.

257
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:45,152
It's been cold all the time. Then maybe God. It may be done, but also for ordinary people. Ordinary ice can't be melted at all.

258
00:04:45,152 --> 00:05:00,172
If you put in a tumbler and put in an ice cube on your head, you'll be playing it all the time.

259
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:15,175
While increasing each other a little. Did you run out of money because you went to bed pretty soon?

Since then. Put this one in. most.

A cat will come out. I'm sorry I got out from 22:00 today.

266
00:06:45,125 --> 00:07:00,118
I want to see it here.

00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:15,103
How about. You might be told that you're in a hurry. There's so much strength.

Please look forward to it. I have a little more throat, but it's still quite coming.

285
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:45,149
I wasn't saying something like what I was doing.

286
00:12:45,149 --> 00:13:00,161
Too much song ties. I wonder if I'll do the Osaka head office.

287
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:15,184
I want to surprise you. So I'm already married. Various things. I was doing my best, though.

288
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:30,147
It's one time for my lover tonight, so I'll fall after that.

289
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:45,168
I'm not impressed with the steps right now. Both dance and sing. How did this come?

290
00:13:45,168 --> 00:14:00,226
It's over. It will take you when you're about to go home.

291
00:14:00,226 --> 00:14:15,115
I got out of the wind in Florida. Please tell me.

292
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:45,157
Let me read up to Natsuko-san and tell me everything I received after that and after that. But.

293
00:14:45,157 --> 00:15:00,140
Really from inside that first. After all it is amazing.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,245
I was wondering how amazing the reindeer was and how crying it was.

295
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:30,184
I had a big feeling that I had to cut my bicycle. Wait a minute.

296
00:00:30,184 --> 00:00:45,158
Recently, 5 years have been my real name on YouTube.

297
00:00:45,158 --> 00:01:00,160
Because it doesn't read Koopa Troopa. Though I will go.

298
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:15,149

00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:30,156
Is it alright. Thank you for the morning potatoes.

300
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:45,153

I was super excited. Great burdock.

306
00:03:00,094 --> 00:03:15,171
I don't have a mom. I was holding the hook.

307
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:30,133
Surprisingly, I don't understand the voice. Even if I have a birthday, I tremble tremendously. What do you mean by stupid things?

308
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:45,109
However, it didn't disappear.

309
00:03:45,109 --> 00:04:00,124
