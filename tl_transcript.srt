00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,187
A desk I'm really sorry, but I'm sorry I got it.

2
00:00:30,187 --> 00:00:45,099
I'm on my way.

3
00:00:45,099 --> 00:01:00,168
It's a little bit dangerous from a little stop. I've stopped by the Goodsun House, so I'd like to make a comment.

4
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:15,160
I'm sorry I'm really sorry I entered this, wait a minute.

5
00:01:15,160 --> 00:02:45,165
What a strange sound the thumbnail has with the guy who takes such a month.

6
00:02:45,165 --> 00:03:00,151
If you don't have the guy who doesn't return the wings and the scissors, the thumbnail will come to the rebellious period. Wait once.

7
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:15,102
Is it okay to have a slightly delayed title?

8
00:03:15,102 --> 00:03:30,321
But I think it's a mystery, but it's a little scary. What should I say this? sorry.

9
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:45,232
I'm sorry.
