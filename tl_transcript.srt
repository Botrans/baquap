00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,137
I have hatred. It's going to be empty. I was fighting 34 sentences.

2
00:00:30,137 --> 00:00:45,146
I'll do it. Can I still go back?

3
00:00:45,146 --> 00:01:00,139
But it's okay. You're turning from Nishinari.

4
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:15,132
I was surprised. Then the bench is crazy.

5
00:01:15,132 --> 00:01:30,087
You got messed up. I felt like it was amazing. The train is far away.

6
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:45,147
But it was strong enough. I will not do it.

7
00:01:45,147 --> 00:02:00,128
I was killed several times. It hurts. Don't do it.

I have it in my roots, I'm empty. Fukui Somewhat. A little.

00:03:00,132 --> 00:03:15,119
Where is the place of rest? Of rest. Go to the place of rest.

13
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:30,161
I'm going to my house.

14
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:45,094
This is the best. What did you give me?

15
00:03:45,094 --> 00:04:00,171
The bank takes care of this tomb and guides the nailer because everyone regrets the sins of the past. You should receive this And is Teacher 500. Something non-non-non-non.

16
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:15,144
Don't bring it back when you get 500. I found that I haven't continued to make efforts. You can train this. 2 consecutive.

17
00:04:15,144 --> 00:04:30,157
Essence 500 Collected or other collecting capacity is increasing day by day I'm glad I just stole it from the wholesaler oppressor. The power to bring the dream nail closer to the plate after returning tired from one of me.

At that time, the secret of the ghost country does not exist. 700. Tsukasa Yumeno What is this?

23
00:05:45,102 --> 00:06:00,129
It's not rain.

24
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:15,142
Look at the roots of the enemy. Where to train? The train.

25
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:30,148
Okay, if not too much.

26

It's like a tied up play store. YouTube Make a legend until the end Will it be a legend? City of tears.

27
00:06:45,119 --> 00:07:00,157
That's not the case. City of tears. I feel like it was 8 on the left somewhere.

28
00:07:00,157 --> 00:07:15,128
Lower left of Kyoto. Is it open? Maybe.

29
00:07:15,128 --> 00:07:30,110
It's not open. This is it. Then it's a crossroads that was forgotten because it's too early to go by this elevator.

30
00:07:30,110 --> 00:08:00,189
Get off from here, get off at the elevator, enter here, and stay here again. Over there or this grandpa.

31
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:15,138
Ah, I just got on from here, normally. Peach effect. The station name is. It's not linked.

32

I wish I could go down to Nameko all the time. water. Do you train?

33
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:45,132
Welcome to Harold. Did you always want to? I'm not saying this while playing a game like this, but I have one news. YouTube.

34
00:08:45,132 --> 00:09:00,133
It became official. I think I have a friend Chome. Tell me when you arrive. It's stopped.

35
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:15,153
I don't know. Onigiri that is not attached. A number of times.

36
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:30,117
It was like I got it. I do not know the meaning. By the way, what can you do if this happens? Is it Kannai?

37
00:09:30,117 --> 00:09:45,155
perhaps. When you enter a person's story and comment, it is signed and can be mounted.

38
00:09:45,155 --> 00:10:00,101
As much as it seems. painful.

39
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:15,171
After that, there's one more thing that doesn't matter. Updated the banner above YouTube.

40
00:10:15,171 --> 00:10:30,084
It was just written somehow. Everyone was checking it while it was sunny. Some patterns of 2 I'm doing it.

41
00:10:30,084 --> 00:10:45,130
You don't know if you can't buy it. I don't have a head for this.

42
00:10:45,130 --> 00:11:00,125
I won't sink, but if it sinks, it will die.

43
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:15,131
why. I'm not sorry. I was seen after trial and error.

44
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:30,135
I haven't gone too far. This is here and there. Uncle or Mister. I'm back.

I don't know. do not know.

49
00:12:30,118 --> 00:12:45,107

00:12:45,107 --> 00:13:00,125
so. Next is. For the time being.

51
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:15,157
While dating Akanishi while drowning.

52
00:13:15,157 --> 00:13:30,130
Cocoichi. Someone like a bomb. I don't know what it is.

53
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:45,124
I'll forget this too.

54
00:13:45,124 --> 00:14:00,104
I'll go over here because it's close.

55
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:15,174
Etch.

56
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:30,128
What is this? key. I fell. Suddenly.

57
00:14:30,128 --> 00:14:45,117
Is this okay? It's been a week. I refused this forcibly whenever I entered it from my head.

58
00:14:45,117 --> 00:15:00,125
went. Grilled potato.

59
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:15,107
Somehow because of the Avengers. There is an indoor bench avenger.

60
00:15:15,107 --> 00:15:30,106
This is not tilted. Only three Russian children. Standing up.

61
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:45,165
what's this. Fierce fierce fierce. It's fierce here.

62
00:15:45,165 --> 00:16:00,129
Agile SHL. Only the one that looks like a bug came out. You won't die.

63
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:15,155
This is an item.

64
00:16:15,155 --> 00:16:30,167
I want a map. I wonder if I can meet this time.

65
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:45,100
The reason why it doesn't make a sound like a father in the morning. You're the one who brushes your teeth.

66
00:16:45,100 --> 00:17:00,130
this guy. This and that. It doesn't look like it wasn't there.

67
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:15,116
Burns hurt but healed but unpleasant soba.

68
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:30,122
I don't like it. Masturbation.

69
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:45,081
What's this?

70
00:17:45,081 --> 00:18:00,098
There is. money.

Company slave night.

73
00:18:30,147 --> 00:18:45,094
You can't train what you don't have fishing. You can also see the map you can see. After that.

74
00:18:45,094 --> 00:19:00,093
I'm back. Smoked This guy isn't cool.

75
00:19:00,093 --> 00:19:15,076

A flower with a map. You can't defeat only such an army. If you haven't trained your weapons.

77
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:45,140
Not Okayama. this. This voice is.

78
00:19:45,140 --> 00:20:00,085
Aika.

79
00:20:00,085 --> 00:20:15,140
A kanji that you have to use.

80
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:30,139
No, can I really stop? It doesn't make any strange sounds. Something isn't on top.

81
00:20:30,139 --> 00:21:00,130
Yes. I'm collecting eggs. A horror hornworm standing somehow.

82
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:30,085
Dead gorilla.

83
00:21:30,085 --> 00:21:45,113
I'm out. Chikushino dentist.

84
00:21:45,113 --> 00:22:00,085
I wonder if the chicken breast will be steamed.

85
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:15,118
Near death. Dad Dad Stop it. Please stop pretending to be asleep and go to the office.

Who is this?

88
00:22:45,122 --> 00:23:00,094
It's Saturday today. Dangerous. I didn't want this. How much do you discover by chance?

89
00:23:00,094 --> 00:23:15,131
The guy who goes up the physical strength gauge. Three more stars.

90
00:23:15,131 --> 00:23:30,096
It's a coincidence now. Can't you go back? seriously.

91
00:23:30,096 --> 00:23:45,130
Yes Yes Yes. Without Google Maps. Marmar.

92
00:23:45,130 --> 00:24:15,131
Be careful with the words.

93
00:24:15,131 --> 00:24:30,081
Because it will fall.

94
00:24:30,081 --> 00:24:45,096
It's pinched and pinched. I'm not caught. It was fun.

95
00:24:45,096 --> 00:25:00,113
Just like this. I came from above.

96
00:25:00,113 --> 00:25:45,136
To bear fruit on white paper. I didn't notice it at all.

97
00:25:45,136 --> 00:26:00,143
There is paper.

98
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:15,134
I can hear my voice but I can't meet.

99
00:26:15,134 --> 00:26:30,058
This is probably.

100
00:26:30,058 --> 00:27:00,208
Unlike the primitive and irregular caves, it's perfect for me to show my talent, but everything here is made properly according to the standards, but it's sad, so I'll sell her again in the future. The exploration of this damp land is almost over. I wonder if the map here and here has been created so far.

101
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:15,124
It's cool with Akko. I wonder if it's on the floor down below.

102
00:27:15,124 --> 00:27:30,122
Narita Spore Forest I can't get out. I'm missing once.

103
00:27:30,122 --> 00:27:45,125
I couldn't go. What this what this. This is nothing.

104
00:27:45,125 --> 00:28:00,125
It's like a statue of a legendary hero. Namba roof tile. There is something.

105
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:15,121
Kenneth. It must be from the opposite.

106
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:30,119
Maybe because I took the charm. Is your house a person?

107
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:45,158
I'll be back, so go home. This is the one I brought from a different person. Twitter.

108
00:28:45,158 --> 00:29:00,136
Hidden door man. I knew it was pointing to George's position.

109
00:29:00,136 --> 00:29:15,141
Thank you for the information.

110
00:29:15,141 --> 00:29:45,085
I'm back. Thank you very much. I'm just going to die.

111
00:29:45,085 --> 00:30:00,130
What is this?

112
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:15,140
Basics that are not vulnerable to attacks from above. Paradise Road weather.

113
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:45,131
Come back, I didn't have any friends. It's complete. You guys are good friends. Tower of the Conqueror 3.

114
00:30:45,131 --> 00:31:00,126
Don't explode if you hit it nearby.

115
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:15,117
I wonder if I want to. Egu Egu Egu. It was messed up.

116
00:31:15,117 --> 00:31:30,130
With this game difference, there is almost no invincible time, so there is a possibility of dying in the barrage world. This is too disgusting.

117
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:45,119
I have a great face.

118
00:31:45,119 --> 00:32:00,116
It feels too bad. I have money on top.

119
00:32:00,116 --> 00:32:15,159
Voice Tokonoma Photo.

120
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:30,113
Ayase I think it's possible.

121
00:32:30,113 --> 00:32:45,106
Welcome. I do not understand.

122
00:32:45,106 --> 00:33:00,135
It's unlikely. There's something above here, so something like this. Would you like to climb? cocoa.

123
00:33:00,135 --> 00:33:15,064
clearly.

124
00:33:15,064 --> 00:33:30,163
I dug a hole in the floor below. The theory that the work has just opened.

125
00:33:30,163 --> 00:33:45,104
There is nothing. This isn't bad.

126
00:33:45,104 --> 00:34:00,097
It broke.

127
00:34:00,097 --> 00:34:15,047
Video.

128
00:34:15,047 --> 00:34:30,121
It became. I don't know.

129
00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:45,105
This is not a boss. This is it. Hebehebenti.

130
00:34:45,105 --> 00:35:00,092
You're a cat boss. No, it's tough.

131
00:35:00,092 --> 00:35:15,115
After defeating two bodies.

132
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:30,145
No, it's too strong and it hurts. that is.

133
00:35:30,145 --> 00:35:45,163
Yamanashi. I took something.

134
00:35:45,163 --> 00:36:00,108
Stupid guy.

135
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:45,113
This game will come suddenly. Sucking nest. When paying the soul of review. A flock of March in Ota appears.

136
00:36:45,113 --> 00:37:00,117
Yes. I want Chitose. What is March? I want an explanation for June.

137
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:15,148
I think it's like living. I can add options. It's a mobile phone. That's right.

138
00:37:15,148 --> 00:37:30,133
Shotgun. Suzuki Shokan Where used. I can't do that. I stopped now.

139
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:45,098
You definitely didn't have to beat the current one. Think normally.

140
00:37:45,098 --> 00:38:00,100
It's about time to be benched and it makes sense.

141
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:30,156
Yua Tsutsui.

142
00:38:30,156 --> 00:38:45,104
Disagreeable. If you hit it, it will be faster. Disagreeable.

143
00:38:45,104 --> 00:39:00,124
This is here.

144
00:39:00,124 --> 00:39:30,121
Fussa. I see.

145
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:45,113
I don't want the sea to come there.

146
00:39:45,113 --> 00:40:00,117
This is a store you can go up to. Proposal book.

147
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:15,150
I'm holding my breath, but it's dangerous, isn't it? America.

148
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:30,121
I really don't want to go there.

149
00:40:30,121 --> 00:40:45,119
It's a shame that the money that has finally died is easy.

150
00:40:45,119 --> 00:41:00,098
Because I have to.

151
00:41:00,098 --> 00:41:15,141
It's hard to use it anyway. Because it's dangerous. Grandma goes home.

152
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:30,129
There is also a meaning I want to rely on my aunt. It doesn't turn from the capacitor.

153
00:41:30,129 --> 00:41:45,087
Do you go seriously?

154
00:41:45,087 --> 00:42:00,134
That's right, it's not just. I don't have money.

155
00:42:00,134 --> 00:42:15,101
2 gauge was tight, isn't it? I couldn't see it.

156
00:42:15,101 --> 00:42:45,143
I lost money and didn't ask for money, but there is something. I'll get it on my own. Even if it becomes 600, only 800 is 700 pieces.

157
00:42:45,143 --> 00:43:00,108
I'm still hungry sometimes, but I took a rest.

158
00:43:00,108 --> 00:43:15,110
It was erased.

159
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:30,114
20:00.

160
00:43:30,114 --> 00:43:45,082
The sound of nature.

161
00:43:45,082 --> 00:44:00,134
It's true. Botanical picture book is dangerous. I will destroy the fountain.

162
00:44:00,134 --> 00:44:15,116
I don't do it politely. I see.

163
00:44:15,116 --> 00:44:30,116
Is the upper limit low because I will regain my soul? So that's it. Where is my soul.

164
00:44:30,116 --> 00:44:45,112
Where are you? About above this.

165
00:44:45,112 --> 00:45:00,071
Sukiya. Chance back.

166
00:45:00,071 --> 00:45:30,130
If you do it carefully.

167
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:45,114
You should be in the middle. I was there.

168
00:45:45,114 --> 00:46:00,165
My dad is in love, right? Here and LINE. Be trapped.

169
00:46:00,165 --> 00:46:15,051
Disagreeable. scary scary.

170
00:46:15,051 --> 00:46:30,195
You have to be a cautious hero.

171
00:46:30,195 --> 00:46:45,087
I won't search for it. I also make a rough book on the left.

172
00:46:45,087 --> 00:47:00,138
Saori-chan can't make it too. I can't make it.

173
00:47:00,138 --> 00:47:15,103
Next is good. What are you doing?

174
00:47:15,103 --> 00:47:30,129
This is tight.

175
00:47:30,129 --> 00:47:45,101
I'm dead.

176
00:47:45,101 --> 00:48:00,094
Life is important. When will i die

177
00:48:00,094 --> 00:48:15,208
When will I die? I have no idea. Why did you sell it?

178
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:30,152
I'm going to Hanyu. Wasted money. Is it okay to say this? If you go through here, somebody who is exploring all of this will go somewhere.

179
00:48:30,152 --> 00:48:45,083
I think I can go.

180
00:48:45,083 --> 00:49:00,124
I'm probably not going from now on. I see. It means that the proper level is not enough. I am.

181
00:49:00,124 --> 00:49:15,112
Already. I'm scared. I'm scared because it's quiet.

182
00:49:15,112 --> 00:49:30,053
almond.

183
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:45,096
Tractor. It's thin.

184
00:49:45,096 --> 00:50:00,050
This is not it.

185
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:15,089
Ichigao. I'm scared, so wait.

186
00:50:15,089 --> 00:50:30,096
It's amazing to touch this. Nothing will come out.

187
00:50:30,096 --> 00:50:45,142
The chain wasn't wrapped around it. There's a front with a keyhole. I don't have the key. I don't have the key.

188
00:50:45,142 --> 00:51:00,080
Just here. The red man in the zone.

189
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:15,113
that's all. It's just like that.

190
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:30,090
FF 10 Anima. So here.

191
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:45,134
I was going to go back the same way, but it wasn't.

192
00:51:45,134 --> 00:52:00,082
Borax. Which is the regular route?

193
00:52:00,082 --> 00:52:15,108
I'm going to see you, I'll be back.

194
00:52:15,108 --> 00:52:30,124
A little. Where is this. Blacksmith Blacksmith.

195
00:52:30,124 --> 00:52:45,159
Opened with a blacksmith. OK. That helps a lot.

196
00:52:45,159 --> 00:53:00,082
Completely reflexes. Ako I think I'm worried about something. that's all.

197
00:53:00,082 --> 00:53:15,127
You can go home. So that's it.

198
00:53:15,127 --> 00:53:30,131
There is no other than England.

199
00:53:30,131 --> 00:53:45,098
It's a mess.

200
00:53:45,098 --> 00:54:00,096
OK I will return. I can't train.

201
00:54:00,096 --> 00:54:15,099
Is it a bench? It's been a long time.

202
00:54:15,099 --> 00:54:30,128
Fluorescent color. The gamecock will be killed too.

203
00:54:30,128 --> 00:54:45,135
Hey. Benz.

204
00:54:45,135 --> 00:55:00,144
Doradora. It has spread a lot.

205
00:55:00,144 --> 00:55:15,146
I wanted to go tomorrow. Maybe it's still early at the level so let's dance or go back.

206
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:30,148
I think it's better to check the color after all, because I want to go back.

207
00:55:30,148 --> 00:55:45,130
It's far away.

208
00:55:45,130 --> 00:56:15,130
sorry. The map is not completed at all.

209
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:30,131
Maybe but it's about time. Of the area. By the way. You should touch it.

210
00:56:30,131 --> 00:56:45,116
I have ani hair. I'm wondering if it's okay.
