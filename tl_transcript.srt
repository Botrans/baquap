00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:45,192
Takatsuki tomorrow.

2
00:00:45,192 --> 00:01:00,112
Where grace and power.

3
00:01:00,112 --> 00:01:15,149
Which is nine steps? It will come out.

4
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:30,100
I was thinking of making it in time.

5
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:45,109
Yeah, it's decaying.

6
00:01:45,109 --> 00:02:00,138
Be a thief.

7
00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:30,086
Hakusan curry. The box isn't inside.

8
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:45,079
Dad is here.

9
00:02:45,079 --> 00:03:00,119
It's not big, so next.

10
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:30,091
Open LINE. It's us.

11
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:45,121
DoCoMo.

12
00:03:45,121 --> 00:04:30,152
That's right, but it didn't react badly. I'm an adult.

13
00:04:30,152 --> 00:05:00,167
It's impossible if it's impossible all the time, but if it's skipped, it's a toy that seems to lose if it's already skipped. It was strong.

14
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:15,121
Windows 3. I was upset and lost.

15
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:30,099
The moment I heard it, I just waited.

16
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:45,148
Dandelion withdrawal It's not the power of animals in the house. Animals were strong, but not humans.

17
00:05:45,148 --> 00:06:15,133
Who will win this? Welcome.

18
00:06:15,133 --> 00:07:00,114
Mono-red is strong.

19
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:15,110
Who is the rumored married woman? Ahahahaha.

20
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:30,115
Who is good at it.

21
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:45,100
Who was that?

22
00:07:45,100 --> 00:08:15,166
Mr. Hirahara.

23
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:45,107
Return home.

24
00:08:45,107 --> 00:09:00,128
I lost to an alien in my stomach. From now on, it seems to be powerful and big. it's hot.

25
00:09:00,128 --> 00:09:30,104
I see, I see. A skin that is not at powerful.

26
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:45,048
Yes.

27
00:09:45,048 --> 00:10:00,118
How old have you been in Tanita? I'm Minami-san now. Yes.

28
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:15,133
It's appearing, so please look for it. It's dangerous though.

29
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:30,169
Where is it. I only talk to Ran-chan, but it's bad.

30
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:45,117
It was a dropper that didn't remain until the end.

31
00:10:45,117 --> 00:11:00,133
I only have the information I heard from Levanilla.

32
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:15,044
The last word from Gorilla-san seems to be sorry.

33
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:30,113
I haven't seen the killifish for a moment.

34
00:11:30,113 --> 00:11:45,090
I wonder if Toyotako is a nerd.

35
00:11:45,090 --> 00:12:45,107
It was written that the audience in the final was the smallest, but it certainly came.

36
00:12:45,107 --> 00:13:00,117
A quieter venue.

37
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:15,113
This is a place where you can buy a strong cut.

38
00:13:15,113 --> 00:13:30,131
Heartful Internal Medicine. Will you win individually?

39
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:45,105
8 Who. The killer remains.

40
00:13:45,105 --> 00:14:00,057
Let's ask.

41
00:14:00,057 --> 00:14:15,047
It's amazing.

42
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:30,129
It may have flown.

43
00:14:30,129 --> 00:15:00,201
Power Rattaner The victory was a strong policy. Cant Believe It.

44
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:15,088
Strong panties and no one is gone.

45
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:30,136
The last stage Nude of a child who never ends. Congratulations.

46
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:45,146
Congratulations. Was it strong in Yamate?

47
00:15:45,146 --> 00:16:00,087
Good word of mouth.

48
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:15,116
painful. Do I have to cut it at the end?

49
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:30,148
Cancan.

50
00:16:30,148 --> 00:17:30,124
After playing, it's overtime again.

51
00:17:30,124 --> 00:17:45,115
Is it over?

52
00:17:45,115 --> 00:18:00,109
Guidance on what to do. You can take a look. Will it be decided by opening it?

53
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:30,115
Are you done? Then thank you again.

54
00:18:30,115 --> 00:18:45,134
Tired. North.

55
00:18:45,134 --> 00:19:00,151
Thank you for your hard work Kyoko I'm sorry I couldn't speak so much because my voice was too loud. I'm sorry I didn't speak unless it was tomorrow, so I'm sorry, it may be serious.

56
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:15,198
I'll do my best to make a lot of voices tomorrow, so I'm sorry, but if I can go tomorrow, I'll do various distributions for a while, so thank you.

57
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:30,098
Bye bye. Rest.
