1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:15:14,626
Good morning No, I feel the tension of today.

2
00:15:14,626 --> 00:15:29,656
I was desperately storing breakfast. The name I quit is lean and dangerous.

3
00:15:29,656 --> 00:15:44,665
I'm really sleepy.

4
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:59,627
Humidifier department with the function of the throat.

5
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:14,646
Yeah, yeah.

6
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:29,605
With rice. Ready.

7
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:44,632
I will continue. start.

8
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:59,604
Eyes often.

9
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:14,625
I forgot the key I got last time.

10
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:29,600
That kind of thing.

11
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:59,674
Flowers are okay. I think I'll put them all on.

12
00:17:59,674 --> 00:18:29,671
It's like that.

13
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:44,653
I'm telling you to give me some medicine.

14
00:18:44,653 --> 00:18:59,578
A little. water.

15
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:14,665
Ah. Even a bear's triangular round square.

16
00:19:14,665 --> 00:19:44,635
I wonder if I can get off I put it in.

17
00:19:44,635 --> 00:19:59,649
D 3 A 10.

18
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:14,663
wash. What would you do then? older sister.

19
00:20:14,663 --> 00:20:29,617
Yes. Of silica. Good at housework.

20
00:20:29,617 --> 00:20:44,647
15323.

21
00:20:44,647 --> 00:20:59,665
This should be the same as the excelave 5323. 1.

22
00:20:59,665 --> 00:21:14,621
Is this true?

23
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:29,618
It's water.

24
00:21:29,618 --> 00:21:44,681
You said it properly, so you should ask for it. A little 123 C. 8.

25
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:59,629
18123. I think it's 1825 when it becomes 1st magnitude.

26
00:21:59,629 --> 00:22:29,586
12.

27
00:22:29,586 --> 00:22:44,611
Because the limited express butterfly is old-fashioned.

28
00:22:44,611 --> 00:22:59,607
I left it.

29
00:22:59,607 --> 00:23:29,626
It has fallen.

30
00:23:29,626 --> 00:23:44,632
Runny nose 02.

31
00:23:44,632 --> 00:24:14,634
You shouldn't go on the anvil.

32
00:24:14,634 --> 00:24:29,623
It's a medicine.

33
00:24:29,623 --> 00:24:44,600
Renaissance Kobe Kuman did it?

34
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:59,641
Strawberries. 1 T.

35
00:24:59,641 --> 00:25:14,608
Anyway, let's go this far.

36
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:59,653
Do this with water.

37
00:25:59,653 --> 00:26:14,683
The flowers and fog are beautiful. Here you are. Bakusai Sanyo.

38
00:26:14,683 --> 00:26:59,656
This illness isn't bad. The leader is bald. I wonder what it is.

39
00:26:59,656 --> 00:27:14,618
Side effects occur.

40
00:27:14,618 --> 00:27:29,649
Above adults. I have a bad feeling.

41
00:27:29,649 --> 00:28:14,557
7 o'clock.

42
00:28:14,557 --> 00:28:29,603
I couldn't see anything. Oita City. I arrived.

43
00:28:29,603 --> 00:29:14,554
this.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:29:46,733
You get a round triangle square.

45
00:29:46,733 --> 00:30:16,781
Swamp early.

46
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:31,700
Something else I need. With an owl.

47
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:46,720
What do you mean?

48
00:30:46,720 --> 00:31:31,676
ghost.

49
00:31:31,676 --> 00:32:46,664
yesterday.

50
00:32:46,664 --> 00:33:01,702
What is the mechanism that I don't understand? An owl in front of a bird in the sky.

51
00:33:01,702 --> 00:33:31,683
opposite word.

52
00:33:31,683 --> 00:33:46,755
It's not impossible to withdraw. This is Kimutaku and Shiino.

53
00:33:46,755 --> 00:34:31,734
Nishikeizo name.

54
00:34:31,734 --> 00:35:01,760
I can't do it.

55
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:31,859
Ko-chan.

56
00:35:31,859 --> 00:36:01,737
Where is 300?

57
00:36:01,737 --> 00:36:16,731
Where are the three countries?

58
00:36:16,731 --> 00:36:46,709
Something at all. I wonder if it means something.
