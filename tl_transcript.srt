1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:13:00,143
Today's trouble.

2
00:13:00,143 --> 00:14:00,121
Yes. I'm Tamaki Inuyama, a man's daughter vtuber. It has already started.

3
00:14:00,121 --> 00:14:15,075
I'm not good at playing games.

4
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:30,149
Today's delivery is a different game, bad shit, the weakest deciding match, everyone, why on Twitter? Well then, it's time to call, but it's okay.

5
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:45,112
Shigure Ui teacher. I have to buy two. I only won.

6
00:14:45,112 --> 00:15:00,124
What I did with me. Ah, but it's a psychology.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,133
At least Tetris wants to win.

8
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:30,136
Let's go at 5000. Let's do our best. I don't know anything on TV. Let's go Leave it to us if the amount is appropriate.

9
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:45,106
Hakase Fuyuki. I'm Fuyuki Hakase, a school girl who has the left side of the Chinese character. You didn't put it in.

10
00:00:45,106 --> 00:01:00,131
That's right. Why is Tetris so bad?

11
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:15,131
A completely forgotten car battery. That's not it. It may be good.

12
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:30,133
The attention of divers is gathering. Let's make it this shape at the end. Apparently, it's also a stupid tuber.

13
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:45,117
Kizuna AI. Intelligent Super AI Kizuna AI. Even if I wonder if I can win if I'm poor.

14
00:01:45,117 --> 00:02:00,132
I'm worried if the red team is okay. Nobody will come out.

15
00:02:00,132 --> 00:02:15,114
It's a super E deck, right? If there is, it's not cheating. Dissolution.

16
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:30,109
It's good to be able to do it.

17
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:45,145
I don't even know about me like this in the first place.

18
00:02:45,145 --> 00:03:00,164
It will be a delicate air. It may be obanzai. Because there are many in this world.

19
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:15,131
It seems that the battle has already begun. There is.

20
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:30,160
Bad shit vtuber is finally planning to decide who is the weakest. I wish I had done it. I won a game that doesn't exist here.

21
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:45,099
The one with the lowest title will get the weakest title. Even if you don't want it, are you only interested in naughty people? Mama Mama Mama.

22
00:03:45,099 --> 00:04:00,120
I'm thinking of earning points, though.

23
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:15,126
Earth Brothers voted to Asobi Taizen.

24
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:30,147
Please look at that while remembering I'm not the only early character. Persona 11 How do you get there?

25
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:45,161
Please do it.

26
00:04:45,161 --> 00:05:00,135
There is a character setting.

27
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:15,148
It's good to lose on purpose. You lose if you have passed.

28
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:30,114
It's almost over today.

29
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:45,126
I'm bringing something that isn't really this great. You can't afford to look at the screen.

30
00:05:45,126 --> 00:06:00,050
It feels good.

31
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:45,140
I'm really a miracle.

32
00:06:45,140 --> 00:07:15,124
What kind of butt when the iron is completed.

33
00:07:15,124 --> 00:07:30,110
Please talk. I'm not a human resource.

34
00:07:30,110 --> 00:08:00,146
Poop is also 3 days poi.

35
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:15,085
The first set of cowpea.

36
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:30,094
From Saitama. It should be weak.

37
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:45,120
This is bad after an intensional search.

38
00:08:45,120 --> 00:09:00,111
You can recover while you are in Hashimoto.

39
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:15,085
The type to be evaluated.

40
00:09:15,085 --> 00:10:30,044
After this.

41
00:10:30,044 --> 00:10:45,156
Aki-kun Time Bomb I practiced even a millionaire who is not good at it, but I'm crazy and I can't win at all.

42
00:10:45,156 --> 00:11:15,114
I'm not this member.

43
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:30,199
I say it's sweeter because it's in this and it just looks good. I don't want to think about it.

44
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:45,160
I chose it, maybe.

45
00:11:45,160 --> 00:12:00,139
Resident Evil. That's right, after all.

46
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:30,105
Shigure is really lewd.

47
00:12:30,105 --> 00:13:30,135
I received it.

48
00:13:30,135 --> 00:13:45,080
It's different.

49
00:13:45,080 --> 00:14:15,123
I went. It didn't come out for a while.

50
00:14:15,123 --> 00:14:30,153
This will be the last match. Precure. Will you come home?

51
00:14:30,153 --> 00:15:00,102
The person who has done it now. But this doesn't come to eat.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,132
Wait, wait, wait. It was really crowded, but what was it now?

53
00:00:15,132 --> 00:00:30,092
Gully of volume. I see.

54
00:00:30,092 --> 00:00:45,132
I'm sorry.

55
00:00:45,132 --> 00:01:15,117
A high-level sight. It's not good that it's accumulated.

56
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:30,101
I did it.

57
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:45,161
Well then, Super Smash Bros.

58
00:01:45,161 --> 00:02:00,165
Terao You've left the room, so let's move with us without wearing it. Glitter in the KeraKera demo The player is a pretty big actress.

59
00:02:00,165 --> 00:02:15,115
I don't think I can win. That's the problem from here. If I had 9 brides and 4 brides.

60
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:30,132
I'm not strong. That's right.

61
00:02:30,132 --> 00:03:00,112
I see, it's changed a lot.

62
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:15,150
If you type in the password, a sword will come in, so I think it's okay if you put it in, but if Ai-chan comes in again, I'll be yes. When it is in.

63
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:30,125
What was the password with this?

64
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:45,094
I can't put it in here.

65
00:03:45,094 --> 00:04:00,104
let's go. There is a possibility.

66
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:15,121
I don't know if it's okay.

67
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:45,151
I don't know.

68
00:04:45,151 --> 00:05:00,094
Hawaii.

69
00:05:00,094 --> 00:05:30,133
This is fun.

70
00:05:30,133 --> 00:06:00,144
Even this is not sweet.

71
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:30,117
Eggs Eggs are no good.

72
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:45,048
I'm not okay.

73
00:06:45,048 --> 00:07:15,110
Is Kami the winner?

74
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:45,126
Ai-chan was waiting for me today as well.

75
00:07:45,126 --> 00:09:15,096
I could do it with a monster ball, but what do you mean?

76
00:09:15,096 --> 00:10:00,122
It's a good thing, isn't it?

77
00:10:00,122 --> 00:10:15,165
3 points. What should I do.

78
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:30,139
I made it bumpy from Children's Day.

79
00:10:30,139 --> 00:11:30,124
It's not interesting.

80
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:45,077
Everyone has to come.

81
00:11:45,077 --> 00:12:30,108
Damn I made a mistake.

82
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:45,090
Team Channel I thought it was the same as me. Everyone is coming.

83
00:12:45,090 --> 00:13:00,126
It seems that the government building was messed up. Hime-chan. Do you understand?

84
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:15,123
Is it all right? It's bad. Because I'm serious.

85
00:13:15,123 --> 00:13:45,117
I don't know.

86
00:13:45,117 --> 00:14:00,075
stop.

87
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:15,046
what is it.

88
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:30,127
You can see it.

89
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:45,073
In an omega car.

90
00:14:45,073 --> 00:15:00,047
PokÃ©mon.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:00,100
It's okay because the doctor will be delicious.

92
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:15,108
Because it is.

93
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:30,084
It's Nakajima. Everyone will do it.

94
00:01:30,084 --> 00:01:45,155
I can't play, so I'm sure I'll get about 5 Hakata gold points. Oh yeah.

95
00:01:45,155 --> 00:02:00,055
That's right.

96
00:02:00,055 --> 00:02:15,135
That's why it's not good to sleep even with this. It's dangerous, isn't it? Stupid-chan doesn't sleep with heat.

97
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:30,130
It's expensive even for cute things, isn't it smart? Hey something.

98
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:45,136
Minami Hamabe. It's a discount, really. If it weren't for me, it would be my kindness, because I and Ai would win.

99
00:02:45,136 --> 00:03:00,102
I don't know much about babies.

100
00:03:00,102 --> 00:03:45,136
hospital. The meaning of Midas.

101
00:03:45,136 --> 00:04:15,138
I go to many places.

102
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:45,162
Let's treat the address with kindness so much that it is troublesome. Do you take too much?

103
00:04:45,162 --> 00:05:00,105
Hey mama mama mama mama mama.

104
00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:15,158
There is a cool mama.

105
00:05:15,158 --> 00:05:30,112
You see this.

106
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:45,120
What is fluffy? Mama Mama Mama Mama.

107
00:05:45,120 --> 00:06:00,102
It's not the first card to put out. Lie.

108
00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:15,117
What should I do? Like a rose.

109
00:06:15,117 --> 00:06:30,113
8 The card you got.

110
00:06:30,113 --> 00:06:45,127
It's not udon noodles. You can do it in Kyoto.

111
00:06:45,127 --> 00:07:15,114
This person is kind.

112
00:07:15,114 --> 00:07:30,205
I think I have a good one. PriPara has come too much.

113
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:45,144
I wonder if I have any more of that-is it a festival?

114
00:07:45,144 --> 00:08:00,094
Twink.

115
00:08:00,094 --> 00:08:30,101
Something friends at school.

116
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:45,101
That's not good.

117
00:08:45,101 --> 00:09:15,183
But if I lose next time, I'm a very poor person. Why now?

118
00:09:15,183 --> 00:09:30,129
Somehow this is something like that. Can I get that number?

119
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:45,118
I couldn't sing. It's a pretty strategic path.

120
00:09:45,118 --> 00:10:00,122
You can't put it out. Except for Lake Towada, it will fall.

121
00:10:00,122 --> 00:10:15,117
Yeah.

122
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:30,096
Voice search.

123
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:45,075
So let's go.

124
00:10:45,075 --> 00:11:00,128
This in Russia. I'll give you this.

125
00:11:00,128 --> 00:11:15,080
It's finally over. have.

126
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:30,115
Maybe I want to go to the sea too.

127
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:45,094
This is too spicy.

128
00:11:45,094 --> 00:12:00,085
With the joker. I don't know if it's good I don't think Joker is good.

129
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:15,088
It's going to go up.

130
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:30,090
I'm worried.

131
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:45,045
You see.

132
00:12:45,045 --> 00:13:00,102
sunflower. Maybe it's full.

133
00:13:00,102 --> 00:13:15,105
I don't know. I took it, but it's something about people.

134
00:13:15,105 --> 00:13:45,157
What are you doing with this mishandling in a tough home? It's not a running game.

135
00:13:45,157 --> 00:14:00,117
I will go home instead. It's the same number.

136
00:14:00,117 --> 00:14:30,093
What should I do. Card exchange is really terrible.

137
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:45,112
My boyfriend is a little bad if I don't drop it This time it's not so good. I think Tai-chan is good from the extreme.

138
00:14:45,112 --> 00:15:00,108
Think about it and talk. Why is it a trash-like hand?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,100
The meaning of that. It should be, though.

140
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:30,110
I'm sure you can see your hand so I haven't seen it.

141
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:45,086
That's too bad. I feel like I saw it for a moment. This does not reach.

142
00:00:45,086 --> 00:01:15,106
I'll push it. Not good.

143
00:01:15,106 --> 00:01:30,101
Because it's important. I thought so.

144
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:45,077
What should I do? You can contact me.

145
00:01:45,077 --> 00:02:00,149
Timing Morishita That's right.

146
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:15,117
Why don't you go flatulence?

147
00:02:15,117 --> 00:02:45,131
Library Amami.

148
00:02:45,131 --> 00:03:00,175
More then, there are two more rounds depending on the next hand. If you don't win the last, this is useless.

149
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:15,178
The last person to do this is strong. I want to be low, but everyone is strong.

150
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:30,135
How to laugh image.

151
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:45,168
That is it. The one who bought this can be in second place.

152
00:03:45,168 --> 00:04:00,143
Millionaire Seo Amount Maybe I understand nothing.

153
00:04:00,143 --> 00:04:15,124
Comment section Plumpy. It's written badly in the game.

154
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:30,120
I left it absolutely weak.

155
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:45,142
It's a revolution, so I can't say it unconditionally, but it's a little different. It's related to viewcards and weak cards.

156
00:04:45,142 --> 00:05:00,107
This is a big evolution of garbage.

157
00:05:00,107 --> 00:05:15,203
Did you understand your feelings? Hey hey hey it's expensive, isn't it?

158
00:05:15,203 --> 00:05:30,091
Stop going to the sea. How old are your parents?

159
00:05:30,091 --> 00:06:00,129
No, but if I don't blame it anymore, something is confirmed. Kanji that can be processed to see if it is strong against alcohol. The joker hasn't come out yet.

160
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:15,144
There is nothing up and down pitch, always always. Dr. Totoro will take it. Item from Neat's house.

161
00:06:15,144 --> 00:06:45,077
I see.

162
00:06:45,077 --> 00:07:00,125
I have that card. Did you go with Ai-san?

163
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:15,129
Be gentle on stains. Yes.

164
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:30,087
It's a shop. I'm scared.

165
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:45,133
This is a revolutionary earring. But I love it.

166
00:07:45,133 --> 00:08:00,139
It was strong though. I see now.

167
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:15,142
The fact that there are many times this time means that I have a lot of garbage cas cards.

168
00:08:15,142 --> 00:08:30,085
That's why the training is not good. I did it.

169
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:45,105
I'm going to cheat this. I got up.

170
00:08:45,105 --> 00:09:15,114
This kitten is a car that is a little funny.

171
00:09:15,114 --> 00:09:30,116
Look at the guys who didn't have the number of opponents like before. Ohno hot dog.

172
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:45,201
I'm not looking for it now. I want to run away quickly. Althorn.

173
00:09:45,201 --> 00:10:00,042
There is.

174
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:15,229
Yasuda Yasushi. I wonder if I want to put it out.

175
00:10:15,229 --> 00:10:30,190
It's expensive. It's open to the public, hug me who I think.

176
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:45,116
It has expired.

177
00:10:45,116 --> 00:11:00,070
Hey hey hey hey.

178
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:15,163
Someday hey hey hey hey hey hey. Yes.

179
00:11:15,163 --> 00:11:30,132
Digestion game You'll cry.

180
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:45,398
Everyone is angry. 10 years without spoiling.

181
00:11:45,398 --> 00:12:00,134
Actually, I was planning to throw these three pieces to Ai-chan.

182
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:15,161
Ai-chan is strong. You guys.

183
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:30,122
The dimensions are different. That's why I can't do it. That organizers.

184
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:45,140
That's why I'm afraid as an organizer. Still. I'd like a point.

185
00:12:45,140 --> 00:13:15,125
Hi there is a possibility of overlapping. Ah, that's right.

186
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:30,097
This is still a return to guessing. So that's it.

187
00:13:30,097 --> 00:14:00,154
Sorry. 5 points. After all it is fat.

188
00:14:00,154 --> 00:14:15,155
How long do you do DAIGO? It's time, so the same day at the end. After that, I got 0 points.

189
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:30,090
I wonder why I should go there.

190
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:45,139
Game bad shit weakest deciding match sign 105 episodes.

191
00:14:45,139 --> 00:15:00,153
For some reason, the person who sent the photo was the weakest.

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,128
I don't think it's good, but that's right. I was good at it.

193
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:30,157
Everyone lost from the basement of Fuku because they became millionaires. I have a desire to live in Kyoto.

194
00:00:30,157 --> 00:00:45,130
Please protect it. It was. Or vice versa.

195
00:00:45,130 --> 00:01:00,123
Angelica Let's listen to your impressions But how was Ai-chan?

196
00:01:00,123 --> 00:01:15,198
I was able to recognize it again. That's that ordinary person who. Sweet barley tea. Ai-chan fights Do you want to go where you feel?

197
00:01:15,198 --> 00:01:30,112
I used it during the last time.

198
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:45,133
I'm going to be a good representative. Everyone doesn't go to me.

199
00:01:45,133 --> 00:02:15,106
How was it now, but my game is good. Yeah yeah I also have one. What the day.

200
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:30,146
Though it is 3, it is comforted.

201
00:02:30,146 --> 00:02:45,204
Maybe I can go, but there are two sweet people in this, right? I think I'll go when I'm the last doctor.

202
00:02:45,204 --> 00:03:00,124
Can you remember Something is usually bad.

203
00:03:00,124 --> 00:03:15,167
But maybe it was eating out, I enjoyed playing various games. Thank you. Mr. Hakase How was your weakest title 8 Dr. today?

204
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:30,130
Even if I was told, this time I was a little bit sad, but my hairstyle is 50 steps and 100 steps.

205
00:03:30,130 --> 00:04:00,112
