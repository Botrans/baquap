5
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:15,137
It was kind of like a mess, a little bit like it's dead, you. I asked how to write the first machine.

6
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:30,148
Who am I. Is it the first machine and the first machine? I don't hate it separately.

00:10:00,124 --> 00:10:15,150
Even though it was my own house, advertisements started to flow.

10
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:30,129
When I watched my video, I was so surprised and cried. I'm glad I updated it.

11
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:45,182

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,140
I exchanged it. Miracle effect is good.

00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:15,154
We all caught Garula. It's a scary deep sea together. It was like I wish I had hit the raid. At that time, I fell asleep.

36
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:30,093
Stop accidents and shopping seriously. I feel sorry for having to do it.

37

A child who thinks well.

56
00:07:45,273 --> 00:08:15,411
There was an earthquake.

57
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:45,209
It's no good. What does the cashier want to say because it's just Pokemon?

58
00:08:45,209 --> 00:09:00,112
I'm sorry. Another one.

59
00:09:00,112 --> 00:09:15,150

First of all, how in 2. From the town. Is it the Shinkansen?

76
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:15,096
It's not a match. Will it be 80?

77
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:30,102
Bring the microphone closer.

78
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:45,154
This is 258-28. I found it.

79
00:14:45,154 --> 00:15:00,089

It's early lunch. Monster Strike is good, even monsters.

83
00:00:45,120 --> 00:01:00,096
I only get that voice.

84
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:30,115
I don't even know a walking cold. I only have 4 days.

85
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:45,104
Really.

86
00:01:45,104 --> 00:02:00,182

I'm glad it's fast. Tell Mineko.

114
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:45,132

115
00:09:45,132 --> 00:10:00,117

Scary scary scary scary scary.

158
00:06:15,144 --> 00:06:45,141
I'm strong at home, so it's really bad to put everyone in. Pokemon image. Not really.

159
00:06:45,141 --> 00:07:00,145
Whether Mari can go in the battle so far.

160
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:30,059
I do not understand.

161
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:45,110

I really want to say that.

168
00:10:00,074 --> 00:10:15,114
I don't know where it is.

169
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:30,118
Kanjani has gone out.

170
00:10:30,118 --> 00:10:45,148
I also wanted to eat Dohideide.

171
00:10:45,148 --> 00:11:15,090
It's dirty.

172
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:30,131
I'm crying or I don't have a water type.

173
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:45,102
The cat bell in the block.

174
00:11:45,102 --> 00:12:15,041
gradually.

175
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:30,074
Gifu Prefecture It's not New Year.

176
00:12:30,074 --> 00:12:45,057
It's okay

177
00:12:45,057 --> 00:13:00,047
What should I do? No.

178
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:30,145
I've become a ghost.

179
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:45,065
This is.

180
00:13:45,065 --> 00:14:15,157
I believed you could do it under the nice bottom. What a bum, but 4 is really amazing.

181
00:14:15,157 --> 00:14:30,115
I fell asleep.

182
00:14:30,115 --> 00:14:45,120
This is not a mountain. It's not falling in the dark.

183
00:14:45,120 --> 00:15:00,132
I'm scared I don't want to lose it.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,202
Wait a minute, everyone. Wait, wait, wait, so it's time to enter.

185
00:00:30,202 --> 00:00:45,117
That will die.

186
00:00:45,117 --> 00:01:15,116
It will fall even in the wilderness. Do it, do it. What should I do.

187
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:30,128
I started my smartphone. I see.

188
00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:45,120
Lucia seems to have done it, Santa. Put it in.

189
00:01:45,120 --> 00:02:00,047
that's enough.

190
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:15,152
Even if you make a lot of heaps, you'll be grateful for that.

191
00:02:15,152 --> 00:02:30,136
He did his best with his heart just because he was sick. Kero-chan.

192
00:02:30,136 --> 00:02:45,135
After working hard, take a rest.

193
00:02:45,135 --> 00:03:15,119
Good luck.

194
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:30,104
It's gone. Also.

195
00:03:30,104 --> 00:04:00,137
Wait a minute, this is tire wax. What's more?

196
00:04:00,137 --> 00:04:15,137
One congratulatory word. I wonder if Ito.

197
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:30,168
No, wait, wait, what should I do? I've used it, isn't it early?

198
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:45,096
Because JAL is the best. UA.

199
00:04:45,096 --> 00:05:15,121
I'm sure the ants are fast. Lego A question that has been asked several times.

200
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:30,132
I used it twice. I was born.

201
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:45,127
The other person. What's next?

202
00:05:45,127 --> 00:06:00,144
Everyone isn't amazing.

203
00:06:00,144 --> 00:07:00,114
I want a little. Monster ball clothing.

204
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:15,137
Thank you very much for sewing at 13.

205
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:45,150
I'm not sure about the 3rd and 56th.

206
00:07:45,150 --> 00:08:00,098
What should I do again?

207
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:30,114
Why wait and wait if you become a Japanese song master?

208
00:08:30,114 --> 00:09:00,120
Watch the situation with Rotom.

209
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:15,081
What time is it?

210
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:30,122
Atrix.

211
00:09:30,122 --> 00:10:00,121
Is that it?

212
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:30,098
You can change it.

213
00:10:30,098 --> 00:11:30,038
Fine.

214
00:11:30,038 --> 00:12:15,091
You know. Of Mali's weakness insurance.

215
00:12:15,091 --> 00:12:30,166
I put it on a bani.

216
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:45,141
What's behind? Daimax's house.

217
00:12:45,141 --> 00:13:00,096
It's not Oshima.

218
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:15,103
Thank you.

219
00:13:15,103 --> 00:13:30,122
Please lower the attack power.

220
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:45,170
What's this?

221
00:13:45,170 --> 00:14:00,129
Do not use holes. no.

222
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:15,132
Just use it for a while.

223
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:30,128
It's really bad. please.

224
00:14:30,128 --> 00:14:45,049
I don't know.

225
00:14:45,049 --> 00:15:00,179
Even if you have an old car, you know what it is.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,085
no.

227
00:00:30,085 --> 00:00:45,151
I see.

228
00:00:45,151 --> 00:01:00,097
House's. It's really in front of my house. seriously.

229
00:01:00,097 --> 00:01:15,190
Even with mahjong weakness insurance.

230
00:01:15,190 --> 00:02:30,107
There is still more. If you give up, you're done.

231
00:02:30,107 --> 00:05:30,134
I made a mistake.

232
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:45,132
Neta blur.

233
00:05:45,132 --> 00:06:00,140
What is this third Pokemon?

234
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:15,107
I'm serious. Ah, I see, I see, I'm still fighting at home.

235
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:30,128
To Seismitoad-chan. It's such a Pokemon.

236
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:45,147
After that, there are various kinds of tea with this 4th purunpurunpurun.

237
00:06:45,147 --> 00:07:00,054
Good luck.

238
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:15,161
That country that came out alone in the transition.

239
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:30,138
Even moms do it and it takes warmth.

240
00:07:30,138 --> 00:07:45,107
Maybe it's best to receive something.

241
00:07:45,107 --> 00:08:00,095
See you. Unemployed.

242
00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:15,040
It's dangerous.

243
00:08:15,040 --> 00:09:00,261
I don't think I can compete with a little errand.

244
00:09:00,261 --> 00:09:15,245
Is it an Esper type?

245
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:45,247
Anyone can go. Mountains are bad.

246
00:09:45,247 --> 00:10:15,133
Okay, I love you rampage.

247
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:45,062
early.

248
00:10:45,062 --> 00:11:00,116
Isn't it really bad?

249
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:15,073
Seismitoad-chan made a mistake.

250
00:11:15,073 --> 00:11:30,059
early.

251
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:45,115
You can climb it.

252
00:11:45,115 --> 00:12:00,080
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

253
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:45,048
It's okay you can do it.

254
00:12:45,048 --> 00:13:00,196
Mom. What do you mean.

255
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:15,125
Who

256
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:30,101
I see.

257
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:45,116
Even though there is such a thing, it will be studying.

258
00:13:45,116 --> 00:14:00,116
No, I think I can go flexibly with what I have learned so far. After all it is better to sleep and die.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,116
Special by all means. Tsum Tsum.

260
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:30,164
What should I do? But I'm always on good terms.

261
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:45,110
Isesaki.

262
00:00:45,110 --> 00:01:00,101
That's it.

263
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:30,109
At least Yoshikere-san is cute. Nice to meet you.

264
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:45,086
Reply through. What is the time difference?

265
00:01:45,086 --> 00:02:00,050
It's dangerous.

266
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:30,127
It's bad if you can turn around.

267
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:45,113
Even moms are good at it.

268
00:02:45,113 --> 00:03:00,127
Maybe I said it again, let's use self-scoring once. Accident loss?

269
00:03:00,127 --> 00:03:15,135
I have to put it back.

270
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:45,143
It's quick to wait.

271
00:03:45,143 --> 00:04:00,091
It 's early over there.

272
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:30,044
you see.

273
00:04:30,044 --> 00:05:00,103
Listen to the complaints.

274
00:05:00,103 --> 00:05:30,085
I don't know.

275
00:05:30,085 --> 00:06:00,090
Bye bye. love.

276
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:30,202
I just wake up to listen to the song on the slope of the butt, but this shape.

277
00:06:30,202 --> 00:07:15,054
I don't know.

278
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:45,048
Once.

279
00:07:45,048 --> 00:08:00,139
Big Dohideide-chan.

280
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:30,123
King The king who came out.

281
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:45,142
No.

282
00:08:45,142 --> 00:09:00,115
No, I'm a little troubled if it's weakness insurance.

283
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:15,146
Kettle Hayatarou If it's early from the other side, you'll know who is sad.

284
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:45,113
Of a girl.

285
00:09:45,113 --> 00:10:15,078
Yeah. There is only this.

286
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:45,047
Let me do it.

287
00:10:45,047 --> 00:11:00,121
Good luck in various ways. It's okay

288
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:15,043
Worked hard.

289
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:30,144
Is it the second floor now? Finally give it to me.

290
00:11:30,144 --> 00:11:45,124
I did it. Well, though.

291
00:11:45,124 --> 00:12:15,125
This is the game. From the opposition. Anything is okay anymore.

292
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:30,073
What are you talking about.

293
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:45,134
Discount That's tiny, but it's strange.

294
00:12:45,134 --> 00:13:00,149
Thank you. After all, this battle is a fierce man full of.

295
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:15,160
It's blue, isn't it a lie?

296
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:45,149
I can't exchange it back. Pretending to have been battled if it was killed.

297
00:13:45,149 --> 00:14:00,135
Do not exchange communications.

298
00:14:00,135 --> 00:14:15,130
Annoying. Everyone.

299
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:30,128
Amigo is 025802.

300
00:14:30,128 --> 00:14:45,151
I have a bug. It will not be displayed as 150.

301
00:14:45,151 --> 00:15:00,132
How much is 4 dollars? I'm on the train.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,100
It's amazing. When it comes to balk.

303
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:30,088
Cant Believe It. Register it.

304
00:00:30,088 --> 00:01:00,124
I'm really happy.

305
00:01:00,124 --> 00:01:15,108
Thank you Broad-san Thank you Magikarp Cute Thank you.

306
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:30,109
It's been a while since I was excited.

307
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:45,118
1 person 1234-25802 Seminar.

308
00:01:45,118 --> 00:02:00,135
Why is Akagi? Look at this face.

309
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:15,098
What a cute current king. It's cute.

310
00:02:15,098 --> 00:02:30,105
What a hell. Find the roots of the flowers normally.

311
00:02:30,105 --> 00:02:45,139
I was grateful for what I was doing. Please.

312
00:02:45,139 --> 00:03:00,090
That's why I put it in this dark ball.

313
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:15,128
Mahjong technique is so cute now. Is that so?

314
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:30,053
Is that so?

315
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:45,129
Bee fly poke.

316
00:03:45,129 --> 00:04:00,112
It seems that it's different whether to go.

317
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:15,086
Sweet veil. A very cute cat.

318
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:30,113
No, what do you like? This is the difference. I don't know.

319
00:04:30,113 --> 00:04:45,044
What should I do.

320
00:04:45,044 --> 00:05:15,101
Is that that child?

321
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:30,135
1234-2580. yam. I'm not silent again.

322
00:05:30,135 --> 00:05:45,039
I don't know.

323
00:05:45,039 --> 00:06:00,103
Is it Kawachi now?

324
00:06:00,103 --> 00:06:15,099
Happy era.

325
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:45,102
What should I do? What should I do. I thought.

326
00:06:45,102 --> 00:07:00,057
2.

327
00:07:00,057 --> 00:07:15,106
Not YouTube. It's amazing. It's amazing.

328
00:07:15,106 --> 00:07:30,125
Parent Halloween. I'm sorry Thank you. Thank you very much.

329
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:45,127
Wow. I will cherish it.

330
00:07:45,127 --> 00:08:00,125
Different colors Rilchera Thank you for being sick. Different colors. It's amazing.

331
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:15,123
There is a space here and there.

332
00:08:15,123 --> 00:08:30,051
Wait a minute.

333
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:45,127
If you try this way, it's completely different.

334
00:08:45,127 --> 00:09:00,134
Take it. Not a hyphen.

335
00:09:00,134 --> 00:09:15,145
Who is your loved one?

336
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:30,141
This is black and this is purple. Thank you very much.

337
00:09:30,141 --> 00:10:00,116
Somehow, I entered Kanjani once more. You've got it. Once a little, even in a match.

338
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:15,130
Is it a battle password? At 2580.

339
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:30,152
Rice flower.

340
00:10:30,152 --> 00:10:45,176
There's something in the comment section too, isn't it? Not so much. Don't put it out. Oh yeah yeah yeah.

341
00:10:45,176 --> 00:11:00,128
It's a gummy candy. Anabuki's dick.

342
00:11:00,128 --> 00:11:15,142
It looks crazy.

343
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:30,156
350. I'd like to ask. I wonder if YouTube is having a hard time.

344
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:45,078
Thank you only 10.

I wonder if it's undead. It's amazing.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,165

358
00:02:00,124 --> 00:02:15,164
You didn't make the decision in time.

359
00:02:15,164 --> 00:02:30,100
I don't know.

360
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:45,155
That's why. That's why I decided on the three Otsuka.

361
00:02:45,155 --> 00:03:15,107

I can still do it. You can pay even if it is outstanding. Overcome that test.

367
00:05:15,155 --> 00:05:30,083
The child is 5 years old. Hang in there.

Wait a minute, put it out once.

379
00:08:45,131 --> 00:09:00,134
It's better to put it on casually with everyone.

380
00:09:00,134 --> 00:09:15,100
Who was thank you.

381
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:30,135

I wonder if it's raining.

404

There are a lot of idyllic adults.

406
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:45,116
I wonder if I can do business. How did you do that.

407
00:02:45,116 --> 00:03:00,143
I can see the bra in the south, but these 9 people.

00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:15,143
It's going to be hard. Oops.

415
00:05:15,143 --> 00:05:30,134
It was fun to say Thank you very much. I updated the rug a little now and it got better.

416
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:45,156
But I need it, so I will play the ending that I said thank you.

417
00:05:45,156 --> 00:07:15,129

What happened to me when I said oregano? I wonder what was said.

439
00:13:00,132 --> 00:13:15,125
As I said before, I'm scared, so I'll get along well and arrive sometime.

440
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:30,147
I haven't done anything, but let's do something like that. You're saying that you really don't like that kind of pulling out.

441
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:45,138
If I always said that I shouldn't be inspired, last year was also last year.

442
00:13:45,138 --> 00:14:00,143
I'm sorry for the red flower branches that I warmed up today. I'm worried about that. I went out to say that I didn't like it either.

443
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:15,171
Oh yeah, I said that many times, but I wonder if it can't be conveyed.

444
00:14:15,171 --> 00:14:30,127
I'm saying it over and over again. I've said it before. Of the train.

445
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:45,137
It's the saddest and scariest thing that happens without my knowledge.

00:00:45,104 --> 00:01:00,122
I didn't want to say it and I wonder if you will notice it. I thought there was no pencil case.
