1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:07:15,142
Everything is in it, so everything is in it.

2
00:07:15,142 --> 00:07:30,166
It's the world three minutes ago, but it's difficult because we have to go eight minutes later, isn't it? From Kaneko-san.

3
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:45,105
That's amazing, isn't it? Really yes. I felt like I might be saying something good.

4
00:07:45,105 --> 00:08:00,111
that is. Why can this mommy do it? So my own.

5
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:15,167
Emergence delivery practice It was hard and fun I was happy to buy I think there were various feelings, but yes.

6
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:30,133
Thank you very much. Are you going over there?

7
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:45,088
Are you there I'm going.

8
00:08:45,088 --> 00:09:00,138
Thank you. I wonder if it's a 3 minute delay, isn't it?

9
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:30,169
It seems that it is flowing, so even if I say this, it will be 3 minutes later. I want to see it. But it flowed.

10
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:45,113
I really send something that isn't that. Please take a look at this distribution.

11
00:09:45,113 --> 00:10:00,122
There is a mark where everyone has a landmark on the bus map. All member introduction videos are played.

12
00:10:00,122 --> 00:10:30,125
Ah, awesome, awesome, awesome.

13
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:45,135
Do you do it in such a situation? Nick Police is in.

14
00:10:45,135 --> 00:11:00,104
This is super cool.

15
00:11:00,104 --> 00:11:15,135
Let's enter Starbucks.

16
00:11:15,135 --> 00:11:30,120
Jojo special OP. The other one is 10 sheets. Where is the opening?

17
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:45,176
Golf 10 before this?

18
00:11:45,176 --> 00:12:00,164
The quality is. It's so expensive, it's too fashionable.

19
00:12:00,164 --> 00:12:15,141
I love trains. I'm a little sorry, but I have no choice but to pull it out.

20
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:30,103
You can't do anything with money.

21
00:12:30,103 --> 00:12:45,130
Please stop the program Why is this voice coming in from Magome? The house is bad This is the blue part icon is interesting. It's interesting.

22
00:12:45,130 --> 00:13:00,128
Please be careful. Meissen was destroyed.

23
00:13:00,128 --> 00:13:15,098
It's different. A voice that helps allies.

24
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:30,111
Yes. From here on. To attack or to the movement of allies.

25
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:45,152
It 's bad, it 's bad.

26
00:13:45,152 --> 00:14:00,100
The battery is out of order. I haven't sent it.

27
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:15,133
It's 7 o'clock now, so I'll ask everyone for a moment. Stop playing online.

28
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:30,114
Maruko-chan. I'm not doing it. I'll ask.

29
00:14:30,114 --> 00:14:45,113
Activity. I hear this story. Noah.

30
00:14:45,113 --> 00:15:00,161
Why my name I'm not a snowstorm. I'm in a snowstorm.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,136
Will we be in production?

32
00:00:15,136 --> 00:00:30,161
What is the rank of me Fubuki-san and Team-kun today? That stands out.

33
00:00:30,161 --> 00:00:45,096
Name bug There are times when I'm in a snowstorm. That's not the case even now. Whose screen is it?

34
00:00:45,096 --> 00:01:00,132
That's right. Even if you take a hot spring, come on. It's really funny, I'm awake. It will be amazing.

35
00:01:00,132 --> 00:01:15,182
Kurumi Kita is saying that it's a snowstorm. This is a little out of this.

36
00:01:15,182 --> 00:01:30,125
But the real thing that really got into it came in. But it's not okay.

37
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:45,108
What's the bug?

38
00:01:45,108 --> 00:02:00,138
passion. Somehow, recently on that Twitter.

39
00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:15,088
Every day ***.

40
00:02:15,088 --> 00:02:30,173
It seems that some people read erotic books before the game. Don't say that. So maybe I should see something somewhere.

41
00:02:30,173 --> 00:03:00,076
Wow this tranquility. Let's do our best. I really remembered that.

42
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:15,078
I wasn't considerate. I wonder if everyone will come out.

43
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:30,118
My hands are shaking. I'll leave my seat for a moment. Well somehow than me.

44
00:03:30,118 --> 00:03:45,114
I can fight something already. The two who practiced.

45
00:03:45,114 --> 00:04:00,099
There are 63 kisses.

46
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:15,098
What kind of Lutina do you wash your face?

47
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:30,152
It's deadly and fluffy.

48
00:04:30,152 --> 00:04:45,096
Let's make the device full power. How long is the device now?

49
00:04:45,096 --> 00:05:00,045
7 times, 1.7 times, I hope it's what it is.

50
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:15,119
My skin is really dry today.

51
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:30,136
It's fluffy. How forest. Terettettettette.

52
00:05:30,136 --> 00:05:45,151
It's hard at night. Move quite early.

53
00:05:45,151 --> 00:06:00,140
Hit from inside. Yokote.

54
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:30,132
It's amazing. 3070 This is packed. Up to that point.

55
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:45,246
It's like Little Team 21 Oita. However.

56
00:06:45,246 --> 00:07:00,318
There is no game you can't do.

57
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:15,293
I have Otaru I have it I have it I can't buy it with my kidneys This is it.

58
00:07:15,293 --> 00:07:45,231
It's important.

59
00:07:45,231 --> 00:08:00,243
I wonder if everyone will be there. I was worried. Precure 3 Precure 3.

60
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:30,274
What's the lobby on the line? Because it's a day, not only.

61
00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:45,168
It seems that if you mess up the anagram, it will be different. 30 seconds 5 times.

62
00:08:45,168 --> 00:09:00,088
Ori. Good luck have fun.

63
00:09:00,088 --> 00:09:15,099
An English-speaking country where you can do your best and have fun. I'm told too. glhf.

64
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:30,168
You'll want to go to the bathroom too. People who have forgotten the restroom and do not come out of the restroom.

65
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:45,083
I wondered what it was.

66
00:09:45,083 --> 00:10:00,114
I also have great treatment. Who is the former NG girl?

67
00:10:00,114 --> 00:10:15,147
It's NG. At the Otani Championship. pajamas.

68
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:30,150
Comment Please also everyone. And you can't see it. Aru-san, of course, can't you see it? There is a 3 minute delay though.

69
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:45,182
It will arrive in 3 minutes. What is your current message? I can finally see the screen now.

70
00:10:45,182 --> 00:11:00,108
Maybe it 's a champion.

71
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:15,127
This person cloud.

72
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:30,155
I look forward to working with you. It's not exactly beautiful.

73
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:45,101
The party is all over. All over.

74
00:11:45,101 --> 00:12:00,158
Look at my head I and my mom fly around 500 meters. Earth.

75
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:15,059
I don't think the left side is covered. I understand.

76
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:30,133
When the community is over. It's on now. I picked up the bolt that I handed over after the bondage.

77
00:12:30,133 --> 00:13:00,120
Forget about leaving it here. There is another sticky here.

78
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:15,152
I'm sorry I may not let you because I'm here because I forced you to do it here. There are many.

79
00:13:15,152 --> 00:13:30,183
I'm sleeping, that's a messed up ass video in dentistry. Part 3.

80
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:45,106
I want two batteries. Nissan 2.

81
00:13:45,106 --> 00:14:00,098
I will stop by the garden. waiting. Close to the center.

82
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:15,134
Only once.

83
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:30,116
It's been 3 years and I want it. Item making.

84
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:45,140
I'm making 6 minutes now, so it's free. This is bondage, but who doesn't have this?

85
00:14:45,140 --> 00:15:00,141
I want another minute. I want to give it to you.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,116
I have only Japan.

87
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:30,132
It's hard for me to put it on my side from the beginning, only in Korea.

88
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:45,081
I want to go get it. I want to go all the way, but I. I can't see it.

89
00:00:45,081 --> 00:01:00,091
There is Japan in the Christian era.

90
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:15,122
What are the fried foods? Maybe you want to go early.

91
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:30,115
What are you missing? Insanely careful.

92
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:45,158
I have about 12 customers.

93
00:01:45,158 --> 00:03:00,117
Fuchu I'm wrapping the shield, but I'm here now.

94
00:03:00,117 --> 00:03:15,117
I was shot by a sniper, but I haven't hit it right now. One syringe or something. Thank you for watching the photo.

95
00:03:15,117 --> 00:03:30,092
Where I can go anywhere. Hotel Aso. Mirage HORIZON race.

96
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:45,130
It looks like pants.

97
00:03:45,130 --> 00:04:00,146
by car. I'll put it in.

98
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:15,158
This is the 8 songs that were taken. It will even recover completely.

99
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:30,174
Tokyo Women's College of Physical Education. That's why.

100
00:04:30,174 --> 00:04:45,080
Turn on the light.

101
00:04:45,080 --> 00:05:00,245
It's okay to see the flow properly. Maybe we walked by ourselves. I think it's Aomori Bonsai Plaza. This is behind me.

102
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:15,172
I'm looking at Ura.

103
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:30,128
I want to make it super dangerous purple. I want to turn off the light anti. HP spell in cell 12.

104
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:45,122
Battery 3 cells 2. Elumi Konosu Parking Lot Kenichi.

105
00:05:45,122 --> 00:06:00,137
Used up to this point.

106
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:15,146
Hideout Boxer If there is an accident. OK OK.

107
00:06:15,146 --> 00:06:30,120
It's okay with no damage. Marvin's dog.

108
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:45,147
Chara, maybe it's probably messed up by myself.

109
00:06:45,147 --> 00:07:00,122
This Mami murder is written from the second floor. I don't want the Robo record to flow.

110
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:15,141
I think it's easy.

111
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:30,155
A sunny shop.

112
00:07:30,155 --> 00:07:45,138
The same right side is coming, nice, cute, cute. There's only one, still there.

113
00:07:45,138 --> 00:08:00,136
I'm watching over here now. Yes.

114
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:15,118
Move.

115
00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:30,104
And there should be a race in the direction of the mountain where the jib is, like a ship. I just recognized it by scanning.

116
00:08:30,104 --> 00:08:45,099
Okayama Shield I will scrape it to revive it. Maybe because it's raining.

117
00:08:45,099 --> 00:09:00,186
It's embarrassing because it moves when you remove it. I just took a bath in the back.

118
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:15,109
This is the party that was in the race.

119
00:09:15,109 --> 00:09:30,140
I can't hit it because it's not in the range of the flatulence. One minute of Cocoland is judged to be post-urine.

120
00:09:30,140 --> 00:10:00,120
So I might come again so I want to go somewhere.

121
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:30,121
It's tempting.

122
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:45,110
Seriously, let's raise the ranking easily.

123
00:10:45,110 --> 00:11:00,128
I want to put it in.

124
00:11:00,128 --> 00:11:15,086
Spasho 10 Because it's the last one.

125
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:30,111
I won't let you copy it. It might be better to go into Ochanomizu.

126
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:45,128
You just have to read the name. Atsumi fashion.

127
00:11:45,128 --> 00:12:00,137
The castle palace is probably at all. By color. Disagreeable. I don't think I'll see it on the contrary.

128
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:15,101
Exhibited from right to right.

129
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:30,130
It's down to the left.

130
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:45,143
Kyoto City Kyoto City. Just be careful.

131
00:12:45,143 --> 00:13:00,133
I still understand. Noah Leon everywhere.

132
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:15,133
Is it a panda team?

133
00:13:15,133 --> 00:14:00,151
Kon-chan's shop.

134
00:14:00,151 --> 00:14:15,125
I thought about it, but I wanted to hold it today.

135
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:30,118
Kuzuha and his friends ran because they would definitely fight. Open at 9. I bought it, but I see. I couldn't share it.

136
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:45,098
Most of the time, I immediately connected to the portal and stayed in a three-person system.

137
00:14:45,098 --> 00:15:00,160
The start of Tamatama's house and Move was a little late. I'm still asleep, and I'm full of money. The black guy, that's why I'm on the road first.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,106
I was fighting home.

139
00:00:15,106 --> 00:00:30,127
scan. That's it, if you can share it, really.

140
00:00:30,127 --> 00:00:45,110
Of a girl. It was about 4. I wanted to say that.

141
00:00:45,110 --> 00:01:00,106
The start dash for that was delayed. Can I do something about it? I'm sorry.

142
00:01:00,106 --> 00:01:15,101
Thank you if you can. Kamaboko.

143
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:30,145
Mama Another store I wish I had been early, but it would be worse at all. If I could send it, this would be it.

144
00:01:30,145 --> 00:01:45,141
That wasn't a problem at all, but I wasn't given the next three bullets. Check if you can say it.

145
00:01:45,141 --> 00:02:15,156
Stop it and you can end it somehow. The correction of the movement is exactly the same as the last time.

146
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:30,123
Even so, the shot of movement was good at all.

147
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:45,138
I didn't even think about Kinosaki. Somehow I'm going, just because I said I'm going.

148
00:02:45,138 --> 00:03:00,137
Only 7 are absolute, where and how should I go?

149
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:30,044
yet.

150
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:45,145
As early as 1 second.

151
00:03:45,145 --> 00:04:00,167
I was ready for the portal, but I was a little confused. Can I do it?

152
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:15,142
If so, we bought it at a high price.

153
00:04:15,142 --> 00:04:30,153
Guts.

154
00:04:30,153 --> 00:05:00,119
I bought somewhere I wonder where this is.

155
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:15,165
Oh, that's right, Kanda-san, I took it for the first time. Is it the juice I was doing?

156
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:30,130
19.

157
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:45,130
4k TV.

158
00:05:45,130 --> 00:06:00,133
I brought about 19 times too much.

159
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:15,124
It's better not to exchange armor with Al except when I'm at home.

160
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:30,123
I'd like you to stop using a computer or something like that, if you can. For example, confirming graduation.

161
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:45,088
I want you to stop after this.

162
00:06:45,088 --> 00:07:00,139
After all it's good at the beginning, isn't it? I can go when I understand that the rear is biased toward the dragon garden in Nakasu. Handa is good at all.

163
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:15,092
The flow is now. It will probably fall at the moment when it becomes.

164
00:07:15,092 --> 00:07:30,111
Somehow, in my mind, I thought there were 9 choices here. If I pay the cobra, I'll be chanting the waterfall. Because it will be.

165
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:45,132
That's the big breasts at that time. Whether it's cool or not is raw when you enter a vacant house.

166
00:07:45,132 --> 00:08:00,158
I wonder if it would be the first floor of a two-story building if it was rolled up. Kasuga can't be broken.

167
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:15,085
I've been waiting for this.

168
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:30,133
The best timing I can move by looking at the situation around me.

169
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:45,133
Presents You can fix it, so you'll be successful.

170
00:08:45,133 --> 00:09:15,141
SM Let's do our best.

171
00:09:15,141 --> 00:09:30,155
I'm not in.

172
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:45,131
As a stupid 3 bullet, I can't see that in the sky.

173
00:09:45,131 --> 00:10:00,129
As far as it goes. Somehow that champion. It will change.

174
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:15,133
I wonder how the big star collapses, isn't it? If there was a fight, that might be the case again.

175
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:30,199
The CD is one more before.

176
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:45,123
It has a little scent. Maybe I met 23 times and met those Kusuha-sans over there. I wonder if I have to fix it.

177
00:10:45,123 --> 00:11:00,131
Speak out that servant maybe over there wife 14. After that, even though there are enemies, it's time to remove them. I didn't.

178
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:15,059
if you can.

179
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:30,136
It's really bad to tell everything where speed is required.

180
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:45,126
One before that. It's a movement of breath judgment at the timing when the fertility is gathered and it is completely out.

181
00:11:45,126 --> 00:12:00,142
If you don't lock it before it comes out, you'll get caught. Go out and over there. Yes Yes Yes Yes I wonder if such a different clearing will be done.

182
00:12:00,142 --> 00:12:15,148
Do you sandwich it with a woman?

183
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:30,142
Dokkan Lane It was lined up with the lane from the back of Tondemon. It's probably because there was a little bit of that in the back than in the front.

184
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:45,093
At the timing.

185
00:12:45,093 --> 00:13:00,128
Anyone in the cloister rule can't help it anymore. I didn't have that version. Home at the portal. The scene that I told the portrait from the state of that house.

186
00:13:00,128 --> 00:13:15,119
There isn't a little. What's the rest? Do you want to move up the ranking?

187
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:30,078
Even if you raise the ranking, a big star. How many points from genocide.

188
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:45,129
7 points or 26? point. Even if you take it.

189
00:13:45,129 --> 00:14:00,126
I have to take it. I had a nose torture, I cut it a lot.

190
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:15,157
I wonder if I'm back, or I'm called Akanishi. I don't think this is the case.

191
00:14:15,157 --> 00:14:30,176
I wonder what that lift is. I think it's strange. Drive away, take skills, and go in and say.

192
00:14:30,176 --> 00:15:00,126
Well not yet. Don't go too far.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,086
Most kills. Honhaneda.

194
00:00:15,086 --> 00:00:30,114
Something is impatient. Like the last nine. I want to activate it.

195
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:45,092
Unless there is gas in the flatulence.

196
00:00:45,092 --> 00:01:00,183
Enter and calm down and put out a nearby bomb Bomb Release. In terms of coping method. Even if I stopped, I was eating everything in the lane.

197
00:01:00,183 --> 00:01:15,093
There is a sense of speed when there are 10 pairs inside. Speed ​​car.

198
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:30,131
Our 1000 Procedures that we put in the absence of anyone.

199
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:45,156
There are 6 teams that are already worth it. It's nice, but it's almost inside. It's probably not wrong to be inside.

200
00:01:45,156 --> 00:02:00,137
Take the house there. Cold.

201
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:30,163
It was sunny, but I have it. The three great genie that cannot be protected.

202
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:45,113
Shy and look back.

203
00:02:45,113 --> 00:03:00,155
drop down. But for the time being, you should raise the ranking.

204
00:03:00,155 --> 00:03:15,110
Such an idea is sweet. It was sweet before. For the time being, I don't know the points that will definitely enter the ranking points.

205
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:30,106
More individual judgment. Some year.

206
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:45,133
Mr. Ozaki I want you to listen to any song. I'm doing it, but it's amazing. Gather in the Energy Report.

207
00:03:45,133 --> 00:04:00,114
There is no left.

208
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:15,131
wrong. I made a mistake. It's said that it's a long time here.

209
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:30,095
One for fishing. The day isn't set.

210
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:45,140
There was also before.

211
00:04:45,140 --> 00:05:00,047
Disagreeable.

212
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:15,102
It became back 2. I don't feel like it.

213
00:05:15,102 --> 00:05:30,125
I feel like I have a bolt, but I have it now, but what should I do?

214
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:45,127
I've put the protein here. It also has extended energy.

215
00:05:45,127 --> 00:06:00,090
One PAR 3 4 type. Home appliances.

216
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:15,182
It's 1. Or see. bolt.

217
00:06:15,182 --> 00:06:30,128
Gaia Naka. The unit price did not return this much.

218
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:45,130
Also OK. Shall we move now? There will be.

219
00:06:45,130 --> 00:07:00,122
Throw it in the battery. battery. Battery 8. I'm sorry, the opposite.

220
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:15,089
I wonder what will happen.

221
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:30,094
This is Ume-kun. I still want to see it for a moment.

222
00:07:30,094 --> 00:07:45,071
What is the range to see at the strongest house?

223
00:07:45,071 --> 00:08:00,093
Morioka. paella. That's Mr. Ueki.

224
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:15,101
If it was the strongest.

225
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:30,104
Ho terrace. Still more.

226
00:08:30,104 --> 00:08:45,040
Be careful.

227
00:08:45,040 --> 00:09:00,131
Yes, it's the item you're looking at right now.

228
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:15,105
It looks like there are no enemies. Basic.

229
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:45,124
I entered 3. Go back.

230
00:09:45,124 --> 00:10:00,156
I'll put it in.

231
00:10:00,156 --> 00:10:30,149
Teleported. You look happy, but I put it in there, but I couldn't see the red dots on the way to sell.

232
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:45,145
10 seconds left. Is it possible that you're hydeing near that red dot exchange? You should see it at 9.

233
00:10:45,145 --> 00:11:00,135
It's LINE.

234
00:11:00,135 --> 00:11:15,122
I'll bring only the TV.

235
00:11:15,122 --> 00:11:30,142
It was a party in Prague Jibrace.

236
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:45,127
Yes, you're telling me if you want to see this.

237
00:11:45,127 --> 00:12:00,184
Tanoue: You're looking at us, it doesn't look like it's in, so I'm cutting it here. At the research institute and above, everyone who came here does not enter.

238
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:15,111
I wonder if I'll try spinning the gacha from time to time. You need it.

239
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:30,104
If you don't tell me, it's fine. I'm coming in front of you. If you understand, you know.

240
00:12:30,104 --> 00:12:45,130
Remove this and turn the gacha. Now it's coming down the highway. I'll get a mug.

241
00:12:45,130 --> 00:13:00,119
I entered for that. Call when it's dangerous. Put 4 batteries 8.

242
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:15,127
I'm watching up to Sakagami.

243
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:30,123
A little from now on.

244
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:45,080
Japan that can be made. How many steps are there now.

245
00:13:45,080 --> 00:14:00,154
Not yet Urawa. If the next move is on the lower side, we've come here and there, but I think it'll be the route here again in Japan.

246
00:14:00,154 --> 00:14:15,111
It's like Orimare.

247
00:14:15,111 --> 00:14:30,117
I'll remove it from Esaka. Can you see this?

248
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:45,043
Thank you.

249
00:14:45,043 --> 00:15:00,100
I'm running here. Metal is waiting in front of the district.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,127
No, it's still okay. over here.

251
00:00:15,127 --> 00:00:45,107
Toyota Patrese.

252
00:00:45,107 --> 00:01:00,115
I put it in. I got this back.

253
00:01:00,115 --> 00:01:15,099
Mirror shield. 1 minute and 40 seconds left.

254
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:30,123
He'll cut, the wall will cut, you can't see it as usual.

255
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:45,129
Even with this, even if I think about it for a moment, I think it's better to write it here. Give me a fighter.

256
00:01:45,129 --> 00:02:15,139
Those who were running will definitely come.

257
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:30,040
Yes.

258
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:45,091
I'm deciding here, too. 27 seconds 10 seconds 6 seconds from Kannai.

259
00:02:45,091 --> 00:03:00,123
How much If this is also good, did you say this here? Now it's out.

260
00:03:00,123 --> 00:03:15,136
It's already tsukkomi.

261
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:30,169
I'll send it, but I'll fall down on Towel-kun. I can't see this.

262
00:03:30,169 --> 00:04:15,059
Still less than 16.

263
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:30,132
I was careful and died.

264
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:45,139
You will never win.

265
00:04:45,139 --> 00:05:00,136
Wild Bird Sniper's Day This is a tough one.

266
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:15,120
If we continue to be big stars, we must improve ourselves.

267
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:30,119
You are drinking.

268
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:45,124
After that, the moment I became a person with that individual skill. There is a place that stands out.

269
00:05:45,124 --> 00:06:00,125
If you paste it on the number where Mr. Kaida is now, the front lane is also specialized in dentistry from the right.

270
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:15,089
Get out of the area.

271
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:30,120
Not half.

272
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:45,139
That's the final story. team.

273
00:06:45,139 --> 00:07:30,121
I relaxed with calmness and Rilakkuma. Various things in the body.

274
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:45,184
Rice What was good isn't a panda to meet over here anymore. Make it so that 7 teams will focus on it.

275
00:07:45,184 --> 00:08:00,123
I see. The timing that Kim and his friends on the right gathered.

276
00:08:00,123 --> 00:08:15,112
I ate it with the thought that if it was bad, it would be easier for me. this.

277
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:45,047
pie.

278
00:08:45,047 --> 00:09:30,113
Even if you earn this time, you can turn by one rank.

279
00:09:30,113 --> 00:09:45,119
Everyone who survived is in.

280
00:09:45,119 --> 00:10:00,127
I became a voice actor.

281
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:30,205
I'm a sea cucumber, the director's team I wonder if the boom is good no matter what comes in.

282
00:10:30,205 --> 00:10:45,165
It's amazing to survive. Because after Leona and his friends are done, that's it.

283
00:10:45,165 --> 00:11:00,085
I wonder what's going on four more times.

284
00:11:00,085 --> 00:11:45,130
I'm worried about the resort. There was one left. That's why it was 1 that was sandwiched in the first place.

285
00:11:45,130 --> 00:12:00,118
is that so. At 1 that was sandwiched. I wonder what about.

286
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:30,125
Well this time it's amazing, but I wonder if there is a team that I have. Let's get it three times here.

287
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:45,123
White LINE points even three times here. You should take a screenshot.

288
00:12:45,123 --> 00:13:00,158
I got a dinosaur. It seems better to receive it, but the management will not come back. Bugs on their result screen.

289
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:15,107
I just wrote that it should be raised. Not a Yamae tournament.

290
00:13:15,107 --> 00:13:30,125
It might be better to have a little bit of Tottori type. I don't feel like it. I got it the next day.

291
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:45,130
TSUTAYA Don't survive from there.

292
00:13:45,130 --> 00:14:00,103
Marmot. Process one by one.

293
00:14:00,103 --> 00:14:30,178
Even if you try to get the best house in the next area.

294
00:14:30,178 --> 00:14:45,119
That's right. Maybe over there.

295
00:14:45,119 --> 00:15:00,153
Who can see the next area? Evolution until I got inside there I couldn't go that way.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,129
I can only see it, but I do. The power of Clifton.

297
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:30,136
I can't. It's not that the defense is broken now when it comes out.

298
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:45,104
I'm just crazy.

299
00:00:45,104 --> 00:01:00,098
Something may feel salvation. Maybe by March, the team will be in the West.

300
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:15,115
Toilet core work. I can't do it, so I have to think for myself. You're messing up.

301
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:30,132
I don't know if it's done, but it's not hot, so I won. Keep it in your possession.

302
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:45,106
There is a face that will definitely come out of the set on the way. Somehow from there.

303
00:01:45,106 --> 00:02:15,124
Iwaki is good though.

304
00:02:15,124 --> 00:02:45,130
Is it difficult to break the goki? I have no choice but to win by shooting.

305
00:02:45,130 --> 00:03:00,129
It was weird. Only about Gasur, maybe Horizon. It was eight.

306
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:15,184
Ah, that's amazing. Send it at all and there is a big star. As for the movement, it's okay because I'm hitting with an answering machine.

307
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:30,107
You can go if you get hooked. I can read it over there.

308
00:03:30,107 --> 00:03:45,126
On the other side in the direction you were thrusting. I might have been able to write one-sidedly.

309
00:03:45,126 --> 00:04:00,138
The doctor also says that it's kind of scary.

310
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:15,167
I was lurking Kaito-kun The team couldn't observe it first.

311
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:30,142
If it should be detected by Kyushu University, it's around. I'm from behind.

312
00:04:30,142 --> 00:04:45,169
Beside the chance like a jumping platform for fish that collects instead of behind the wall.

313
00:04:45,169 --> 00:05:15,162
Besides, if I didn't come from now on, I would have been a horse.

314
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:30,190
No, it really worked, though I'm really home. Something is here.

315
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:45,162
The flow of movement. After that, there is no choice but to get noticed between the two of us. The movement is really good during this battle.

316
00:05:45,162 --> 00:06:00,157
Nakasu Lane Kill Evolutionary Material Bread Compete for another second.

317
00:06:00,157 --> 00:06:15,115
Toki City. Takasaki City.

318
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:30,128
after. That's him.

319
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:45,129
Then it may be doing well.

320
00:06:45,129 --> 00:07:00,156
I haven't been freaking out at all since I started passing each other, so really. There is no problem at all.

321
00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:15,059
Really.

322
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:30,097
Ayane doesn't decrease at all. All 20 pairs are available. Maybe 2 games with full members.

323
00:07:30,097 --> 00:07:45,145
10 It's different. I went to a place I thought I didn't have. I told you yesterday. It's a boy.

324
00:07:45,145 --> 00:08:00,137
If there is rain, there will be rain. The bullet speed must be crushed. There are options for that.

325
00:08:00,137 --> 00:08:15,120
I see, he says he'll knock it down. I have to take it with me. It's Bibi-chan.

326
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:30,122
There is that with Babycon. Isn't it okay?

327
00:08:30,122 --> 00:09:00,102
Calmly liven up.

328
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:15,155
Is it okay? now. That's why. No one has to say.

329
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:30,146
OK. It was good to balance with the empty land of Senna.

330
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:45,139
The request of Anime Bolt. I learned Spitfire.

331
00:09:45,139 --> 00:10:00,148
Red flowers White flowers.

332
00:10:00,148 --> 00:10:15,157
It's on the shotgun bolt. I have a gift 08.

333
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:30,117
What's wrong with energy? I want it. Because there is BLEACH.

334
00:10:30,117 --> 00:10:45,135
Siri is in Japan. Now it's Japan. I'm making it.

335
00:10:45,135 --> 00:11:00,125
3 volt level.

336
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:15,160
It's too bad to be a snake ball. This is messed up. Do a little at my house.

337
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:30,126
I have four. This is all right.

338
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:45,174
90.

339
00:11:45,174 --> 00:12:00,150
It was a bug that entered and I was about to enter it without sound. Let's enter soon. Haranishi I don't have my clan shield right now.

340
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:15,177
Belial isn't open. I wonder if there are no traces. Then you can go anytime because it has accumulated. I don't understand this meaning for a moment.

341
00:12:15,177 --> 00:12:30,170
Do the best. Only 40 Hiro and Itamastiff. A snake at Dazaifu.

342
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:45,111
I'm watching over here. Let's go now.

343
00:12:45,111 --> 00:13:15,153
Is in bloom.

344
00:13:15,153 --> 00:13:45,104
I saw the actor in various ways.

345
00:13:45,104 --> 00:14:00,143
I was around here. Fly and fly.

346
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:15,164
But maybe. I entered twice.

347
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:30,152
Hearts copy I can't give you a little.

348
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:45,132
This is the best. Is it okay to wear clothes for about another minute?

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,177
Non-erotic anime and pink The name has become a ship. Horizon It's called Horizon Juku.

350
00:00:30,177 --> 00:02:00,163
I'm watching here, I'm watching, I'm watching.

351
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:15,106
This is watching.

352
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:30,072
I'm watching over here forever. I'm doing it.

353
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:45,093
I don't know. I understand what people were saying. First.

354
00:02:45,093 --> 00:03:00,077
I'm watching over here.

355
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:15,137
Then you should enter this once more. authority. Still me.

356
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:30,099
I'm going to the sea.

357
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:45,134
It's blooming here with Tomica It's blooming.

358
00:03:45,134 --> 00:04:00,100
Understood this is.

359
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:15,140
I want to pick it up, but I do.

360
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:30,124
But the reason why you can see it or not go to the center.

361
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:45,109
Gure throw.

362
00:04:45,109 --> 00:05:45,044
sorry.

363
00:05:45,044 --> 00:06:00,151
15 seconds left. I'm looking outside The sticker clock is huge.

364
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:15,115
Big deca meat Pokemon with a lot of meat.

365
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:30,126
I'll teach you there. I've come to 108.

366
00:06:30,126 --> 00:06:45,201
I have no choice. Stupid guy.

367
00:06:45,201 --> 00:07:00,124
But there is no choice but to sprinkle. I'm crying now.

368
00:07:00,124 --> 00:07:15,148
Still 14 stages from here. You may come to this wall.

369
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:30,099
Maybe if it's hot. I'm sorry I'm eating.

370
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:45,106
3 par scans 5 seconds left.

371
00:07:45,106 --> 00:08:15,138
I'm at least coming myself. Fine.

372
00:08:15,138 --> 00:08:30,061
it's hot.

373
00:08:30,061 --> 00:09:00,118
But was it good? If the door is torn, the immediate putt is probably the highest priority.

374
00:09:00,118 --> 00:09:15,159
It happened that the other party was so noisy in a certain state. Because it will be an affair. Calmly arrive at a country's house.

375
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:45,165
It took me. Because the other party threw it and thrust it in and fell down.

376
00:09:45,165 --> 00:10:00,163
How much Then.

377
00:10:00,163 --> 00:10:15,157
I felt like it was a movement.

378
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:30,104
Everyone around me is strong. pupula.

379
00:10:30,104 --> 00:10:45,154
This is from person to person. Ark star board.

380
00:10:45,154 --> 00:11:15,147
That's right. Because I lost. There was no difference in that ratio.

381
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:30,113
A store with trees calmly later.

382
00:11:30,113 --> 00:11:45,123
If anyone has a thermite. I wonder if it has become a medicine for bokeh.

383
00:11:45,123 --> 00:12:15,129
It was super affordable.

384
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:45,165
I want to survive to Piago's garden I want to win today.

385
00:12:45,165 --> 00:13:15,163
This picture is angry at this custom practice.

386
00:13:15,163 --> 00:13:30,128
This is the one that Yuki-chan and his friends bought by telling them where they bought it. 6 Stage.

387
00:13:30,128 --> 00:14:15,175
It seems to be difficult when there is no pick-up to climb this first.

388
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:45,175
What is it now? I don't have one.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,076
I'm a 3-year-old child.

390
00:00:15,076 --> 00:00:30,087
This is a baby messed up.

391
00:00:30,087 --> 00:00:45,126
Even this is in.

392
00:00:45,126 --> 00:01:00,070
Runaway It's like a runaway locomotive.

393
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:15,171
Crypto drone Last one. Oh, that's what it is.

394
00:01:15,171 --> 00:01:30,105
Crypto. Because there is Ueno, the final board value value place.

395
00:01:30,105 --> 00:01:45,125
It's powerful.

396
00:01:45,125 --> 00:02:00,121
It hasn't grown that much, but the ranking is. If you survive, within the Terajima character.

397
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:30,140
No, I don't care about anything. That's why I lost.

398
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:45,093
That's great.

399
00:02:45,093 --> 00:03:30,102
A little while ago.

400
00:03:30,102 --> 00:03:45,126
It hurt. When. I think it's the moment I came.

401
00:03:45,126 --> 00:04:00,134
Braha is also fine.

402
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:15,122
I was an old man myself, but when I saw it.

403
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:30,104
I bought it.

404
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:45,120
Well instead of being stabbed. All of today's games are in Saitama prefecture. Are you okay.

405
00:04:45,120 --> 00:05:00,128
It's not, it's completely my move. Because there is insufficient information transmission.

406
00:05:00,128 --> 00:05:15,204
Murayama, Isa City, the third match from Ishiyama Nishiyama. If the lift is also calm, mommy will flush it every time it's over.

407
00:05:15,204 --> 00:05:30,137
I was hit by the one I spoke to.

408
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:45,142
When it doesn't get a reply, it's basically annoying. When it gets a reply, it's basically not so much. Even if I say that I'm waiting for that, it's absolutely structurally human body.

409
00:05:45,142 --> 00:06:00,194
It's finished and it's a fish.

410
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:15,116
It's really okay. The movement is really someone in the custom so far, those 20 pairs. Best thing. 1 dollar.

411
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:30,131
Still steppers around. That's true. Honestly as to whether to win or lose high.

412
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:45,170
But something goes here. I heard that. It was stolen because I could judge it by going.

413
00:06:45,170 --> 00:07:00,173
Yeah. Which sphere should I use? I feel like I'm rushing.

414
00:07:00,173 --> 00:07:15,098
This time is the last. What a sushi restaurant.

415
00:07:15,098 --> 00:07:30,165
I didn't know what it was. I was the secretary because I got it, but I'll guide you.

416
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:45,136
It's kind and strong, and I'm good at other teams. The stars are crowded.

417
00:07:45,136 --> 00:08:00,125
I think it's all just money, but it's the same everywhere. I wish I could fight over there and win.

418
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:30,164
This is the only team left here.

419
00:08:30,164 --> 00:08:45,127
I see. No one is an experienced custom.

420
00:08:45,127 --> 00:09:00,094
I've only been doing it for the past week.

421
00:09:00,094 --> 00:09:15,127
The difference in the actual production assumption is that Mr. Homma's experience value type is not enough. I don't think it's because I feel so nervous, but I think it's the same as usual.

422
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:30,136
Taguchi is fast, isn't it? Bad videos for people who are used to it.

423
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:45,147
Do you know the team with few mistakes that there is no waste?

424
00:09:45,147 --> 00:10:00,095
Let's win.

425
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:15,106
Please cry and apologize for 6000 yen memo.

426
00:10:15,106 --> 00:10:45,112
That's about 3. You may not want to have it, but anything else, maybe a month or so, what is a wink?

427
00:10:45,112 --> 00:11:00,111
I'll love you again. Heights.

428
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:15,171
The longer the distance, the more I feel that it is falling. That's right. I haven't come yet.

429
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:45,130
I like sound, I like that. That's what I say, that guy. The begins.

430
00:11:45,130 --> 00:12:00,096
Please. You can see it with a microphone.

431
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:15,139
Don't write it. Grandis Yeah, I'm drinking the real thing. That's why.

432
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:30,070
Fine.

433
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:45,180
There are some who are really good at the Yankees of the Iryu Sosa. I'll study something. Will it take the place of the country during the tournament?

434
00:12:45,180 --> 00:13:00,122
I'll do it again.

435
00:13:00,122 --> 00:13:15,148
I'm looking forward to working with you. So maybe I'm looking at the covered ridge, but I don't think it's there.

436
00:13:15,148 --> 00:13:30,149
Chateraise. There was also 3 of the extended lights.

437
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:45,135
There are also affiliates. Please use a pin bill or something.

438
00:13:45,135 --> 00:14:00,140
I picked up an 8-shotgun bolt and will give it to someone.

439
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:15,133
Would you like to go if it's metal? I've been waiting for it. I have a lot of balls and M 6s. Look at the beacon.

440
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:30,188
Well, I need it for a big battery. Necessary Fight Night Cold River.

441
00:14:30,188 --> 00:15:00,090
Where did you go

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,115
I'm not stupid. I wonder if it's power.

443
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:30,080
Mom is also made.

444
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:45,100
If you go, you can go anywhere, but I wonder if there is not enough rain.

445
00:00:45,100 --> 00:01:00,110
Ame-chan over there. What if I felt like the reaction was right? I'll put a shotgun bolt.

446
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:15,127
Haircut when handing over to Puni.

447
00:01:15,127 --> 00:01:30,140
Floor jump. Jump jump. One jump.

448
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:45,188
I don't know if this is missing, so I want to use it at such times. This is ok.

449
00:01:45,188 --> 00:02:00,126
It's a little more expensive. 9 I'll put it in. An important salary that goes all the way to the end.

450
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:15,145
I'll do my best with the regular script. 8.3.

451
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:30,142
Someone has this thermite, I have it.

452
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:45,102
That's why I made it my purpose. Only one going to the center line. Is this also?

453
00:02:45,102 --> 00:03:30,087
The name that was just hey.

454
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:45,085
I'll hit you a little. I'm getting a light.

455
00:03:45,085 --> 00:04:00,061
bus.

456
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:15,125
Cocoichi This shirt.

457
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:30,088
It's hard for me too.

458
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:45,161
Maybe it's almost all inside. There is. I have to run out of breakfast.

459
00:04:45,161 --> 00:05:00,159
I haven't received it. What's going on? It's possible that he's there, but he doesn't come in the current battle.

460
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:15,045
Thank you. Isn't it?

461
00:05:15,045 --> 00:05:30,102
battery. It seems that there are about 4 Matsuyama Minami.

462
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:45,126
I can see one person. I can only see it in the north right now.

463
00:05:45,126 --> 00:06:00,165
I'm here with a breath I think I'm going to sleep. I want you to bring the store.

464
00:06:00,165 --> 00:06:15,082
Still more. now. I'll still see it.

465
00:06:15,082 --> 00:06:30,131
Well, from what time.

466
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:45,090
Sorry Sorry. If you try to escape all over the country. That's what I'm on.

467
00:06:45,090 --> 00:07:00,125
I want to take a fierce approach.

468
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:15,118
But also. But there are only two, but everyone has quite a few. Who is this? awake.

469
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:30,105
But there is. You know

470
00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:45,092
Time between mountain days. If you do not admit a little.

471
00:07:45,092 --> 00:08:00,124
It's not a plane, where was it shot from now? I want to know more about the sea.

472
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:15,109
I've been carrying it with me.

473
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:30,135
Oh completely.

474
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:45,112
I will do it. 5 cm small.

475
00:08:45,112 --> 00:09:00,107
First of all, Kilimanjaro.

476
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:15,143
3 hours fucking Mao runner.

477
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:30,117
There is an octopus in this inner pool. If you hit.

478
00:09:30,117 --> 00:09:45,129
This is from an oasis. I don't know because I haven't seen it. I'm a little wary of this.

479
00:09:45,129 --> 00:10:00,115
I'm injured so try it together. Because it blows through.

480
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:15,175
What doesn't fit Now it doesn't fit.

481
00:10:15,175 --> 00:10:45,110
Scary thing. I can meet you.

482
00:10:45,110 --> 00:11:00,151
It's definitely not noisy if there is a Horizon. That's right, it's really explosive and strong. That time, I was.

483
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:15,095
Everyone.

484
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:30,105
Ama-chan.

485
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:45,119
90 seconds left.

486
00:11:45,119 --> 00:12:00,084
Thank you.

487
00:12:00,084 --> 00:12:30,110
Janjan-tei.

488
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:45,080
I'm using it all the time.

489
00:12:45,080 --> 00:13:00,112
It's difficult, be careful.

490
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:15,117
Hang a broken knife.

491
00:13:15,117 --> 00:14:00,114
Tanaka and everyone. The total is where I am.

492
00:14:00,114 --> 00:14:45,134
I have two ALSOK I have two ALSOK Someone. If you cut this, it won't cut into pieces. Yes, it's here.

493
00:14:45,134 --> 00:15:00,134
The front. This is right.

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,095
When I come back again

495
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:45,136
I can't sell it.

496
00:00:45,136 --> 00:01:00,125
I knew it was there, but it passed. It's natural, I'm checking over there.

497
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:30,090
Fight. At that site. I'll lose money.

498
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:45,128
Do your best and lose, stick it again and finish. If I didn't stop it, that would be a burn. Yeah.

499
00:01:45,128 --> 00:02:00,042
That is.

500
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:15,149
The child I put in Jim 122 teacher's address. But it shouldn't be. I'm dead.

501
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:30,126
You're Under Arrest.

502
00:02:30,126 --> 00:02:45,118
End the battle smartly. All matches.

503
00:02:45,118 --> 00:03:00,097
All of the high awareness of illness. That's fine.

504
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:15,134
I'm saying it's over there, but I'm Mako-chan too.

505
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:30,041
At the timing.

506
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:45,143
But it's amazing that everyone is looking forward, but in that direction. Yeah. I had to bring it with me.

507
00:03:45,143 --> 00:04:00,090
It's already 3 units.

508
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:15,094
We messed up with the rules on the north side. Well with modules. I bought it at all.

509
00:04:15,094 --> 00:04:30,043
So that's it.

510
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:45,104
Position lamp. This is Lily from Yuki-chan's place.

511
00:04:45,104 --> 00:05:00,108
Remain properly. I'm not here tomorrow.

512
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:15,123
If it breaks, that's it.

513
00:05:15,123 --> 00:05:30,143
No, this is. Also receive it in 3 and cut it off completely.

514
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:45,134
It was a good move, but maybe the other party is good.

515
00:05:45,134 --> 00:06:00,145
Yao City Good, we don't really drink. You can even get it off with a floating ring.

516
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:15,127
I want to raise the ranking. I'm taking the juice.

517
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:30,148
Nijisanji, don't you do anything? Money is amazing and heavy.

518
00:06:30,148 --> 00:06:45,224
21 and 18 are included. That's right, this time it's 09. I wonder if I can go this. It's about ton ton.

519
00:06:45,224 --> 00:07:00,108
Another one. It's huge because it overlaps with 12.

520
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:30,054
Yes.

521
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:45,151
Laugh even if you cry very much. It's really good physical and no one is bad.

522
00:07:45,151 --> 00:08:00,177
Get close to me. That's why I got tired of being liked by everyone over there.

523
00:08:00,177 --> 00:08:15,115
In kanji. I wonder what is the last on the right.

524
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:30,138
I feel like I did it in that way. The windows are cleaned, but it's more troublesome. What will you give me? If there is a child looking for something.

525
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:45,113
Avoid gasoline. Among the options, menstruation must be old.

526
00:08:45,113 --> 00:09:00,173
That is smart. Even though I haven't, I can still stay up to the last circle.

527
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:15,081
Do a great number.

528
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:30,118
No, no. I got the money.

529
00:09:30,118 --> 00:09:45,096
It was 40 seconds. It was really fast. Dear wounds I noticed.

530
00:09:45,096 --> 00:10:00,138
It's okay to wait if you have one phone left. Don't spend any money later. I noticed that it wasn't.

531
00:10:00,138 --> 00:10:15,170
For the time being, if you open it already, you should make a battery. Today is Marsutere Ishida there. There may be spring flowers as well.

532
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:30,129
Let's get out at all. I don't want to say that.

533
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:45,107
Her hope. You understand.

534
00:10:45,107 --> 00:11:00,106
That's right.

535
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:15,111
I want to be quick soon. It's messed up in the sense that it makes me scared.

536
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:30,111
I'm running.

537
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:45,208
If you don't like it, you won't know when you don't have a lot of winners. Don't go to the top. Leona's team is a mess.

538
00:11:45,208 --> 00:12:00,097
I don't know, but I don't know. Yukijiro's team. I am.

539
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:15,098
It's fun and interesting. Something interesting.

540
00:12:15,098 --> 00:12:30,155
You use your head a lot. At all. It's the same as casual things like not doing anything.

541
00:12:30,155 --> 00:12:45,148
Maenosho Lend me the most points.

542
00:12:45,148 --> 00:13:00,112
Do it every week for a year. One year one year later.

543
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:15,150
I went to the original 60 pairs instead of 20 pairs and sampled. On the contrary, there are 5 pairs in the final match, not 10 pairs.

544
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:30,105
You did it as a team. If you have 5 pairs, you'll have all the weapons. Yuuka Uchimura.

545
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:45,125
Because I will go with high fighting ability. You say it like an evil thought. I don't want it.

546
00:13:45,125 --> 00:14:00,138
But when it comes to hot plate competitions, it's about that.

547
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:15,129
If the financial resources are great and the participation fee is 10 million. My system isn't like this tournament, it's just this period, it's like a game of the season.

548
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:30,131
It seems that you will earn points by lying, so at the end I bought it when I saw the World World Match.

549
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:45,143
Because there are so many teams. I don't feel sick. When it comes to something, it really sounds like it just sounds.

550
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,102
I won't lend you such a member change. Such sea fishing. overseas.

551
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:45,125
I wonder if it's out, this is a search.

552
00:00:45,125 --> 00:01:00,130
Two people scraped it with one Tegomass stiff. Please clean it. At the end I drank it, but I think I'm doing well.

553
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:15,036
Really.

554
00:01:15,036 --> 00:01:30,134
Because the skill of the mountaintop in the area is to prevent the lane on the other side.

555
00:01:30,134 --> 00:01:45,146
Because it's a song.

556
00:01:45,146 --> 00:02:00,194
I bought a fight. Because it's right.

557
00:02:00,194 --> 00:02:15,119
The moment I cut it all out, I feel like I'm being done in the main.

558
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:30,158
I don't feel like I'm losing with all my strength. It doesn't have to be flat. Someone set it up.

559
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:45,164
Also over here. I wonder if there is something like Yoshine.

560
00:02:45,164 --> 00:03:00,051
Then.

561
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:15,151
Mood making. From the feeling of how far away from the microphone.

562
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:30,149
The two are really the correct route. It's not really bad if you can see it.

563
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:45,133
Total damage man train. Beacon.

564
00:03:45,133 --> 00:04:00,144
Today House Kanabi Forma What time would you go to bed at night? Thank you. Fly at 500 Flying bite.

565
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:30,124
Now that I'm about to report.

566
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:45,121
I wonder if iQOS can't be exchanged From now on, I sang Western music and had my tongue red mumble.

567
00:04:45,121 --> 00:05:00,145
Ah, it's okay. I picked it up, but it's the second one.

568
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:15,130
Another one. There are twice as many.

569
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:30,063
I may not have a bag.

570
00:05:30,063 --> 00:06:00,181
You can take this out and drop it there. I'll exchange it because I have three.

571
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:15,119
Make one. You don't come.

572
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:30,136
Ah, I don't have a loss Eh this is the area of ​​the town. Dekimachi.

573
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:45,080
Reiwa-kun and others will definitely go here.

574
00:06:45,080 --> 00:07:00,105
Well another betel chick.

575
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:15,136
I need a battery Combined batteries I can't even make a battery with this one. Look for a little energy ammo without anything.

576
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:30,124
There are two more. I'm sorry. I'm looking for it, just reporting that I haven't seen it.

577
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:45,157
So I'm looking for it already. I won't go with this.

578
00:07:45,157 --> 00:08:00,118
Ame Talk Hey, right now. I want to be here.

579
00:08:00,118 --> 00:08:15,133
Do your best for a moment.

580
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:30,177
I'm running here. I'm here too. I got off next door.

581
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:45,061
You're here.

582
00:08:45,061 --> 00:09:00,068
A little over there I'm in a country waiting because it's far away.

583
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:15,091
Go buy the one on the upper right.

584
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:30,143
If you can't move the most, you can't move.

585
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:45,051
What's going on

586
00:09:45,051 --> 00:10:00,105
I was sleeping here too.

587
00:10:00,105 --> 00:10:15,117
I wonder if it's all good next time.

588
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:30,130
Isn't it good?

589
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:45,094
That's pretty much in it.

590
00:10:45,094 --> 00:11:00,119
Because it is the strongest shot from behind. Yes fluttering.

591
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:15,126
Put it in Haru-san's house. It's on my own.

592
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:30,119
It's sunny. You have to be careful behind you. It feels like you can make an emergency on this side from the window of your house.

593
00:11:30,119 --> 00:12:00,104
It feels like a trickster. I will never lose. just in time.

594
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:15,121
Miya Tako. 9 Octopus I'm saving money. Enter from the middle alone.

595
00:12:15,121 --> 00:12:30,121
I'm in the middle of the front, even now.

596
00:12:30,121 --> 00:13:00,131
I love you I love you I love you I love you

597
00:13:00,131 --> 00:13:15,127
The rain that came back. Maybe I'm not in the trattoria.

598
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:30,145
I'm sending an email to Yahoo Auction. In total, I'll pack it that far. It's like hitting inside the house.

599
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:45,129
On the roof. Jimny Shirahama.

600
00:13:45,129 --> 00:14:00,098
This is 9 No, it's still quite that time 30 minutes timer.

601
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:15,089
It hasn't started yet. Staring contest has begun, and the river.

602
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:30,153
That's right, I have to go home. With one person who is quite on the feet. There are 3 people here. ..

603
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:45,100
It seems better to think about the latter. I'll say OK.

604
00:14:45,100 --> 00:15:00,147
Ult I think it's 60 par now. This one was missing Two people were missing The slope is up.

605
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,193
About 55 at about 6 o'clock I'm now 73.9 seconds later. I'm here.

606
00:00:30,193 --> 00:00:45,118
This picture I'm not here under here. It came off.

607
00:00:45,118 --> 00:01:00,149
No, there's no one below it. Nobody left. Nobody.

608
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:15,116
The kids don't go at all. Do you get it.

609
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:30,137
You can listen to it in the right style. I've been feeling it for a long time

610
00:01:30,137 --> 00:02:00,100
Ijiri-kun may go a little. OK I didn't understand.

611
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:15,100
I sell it, but I can't win this.

612
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:30,154
I've already gone to eat even one person below. The team that was glaring at each other is here.

613
00:02:30,154 --> 00:02:45,148
I'm climbing from here, so I went there at all.

614
00:02:45,148 --> 00:03:00,171
Then I'm watching bonsai. You're here It looks like you're here.

615
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:15,094
Good luck with the game.

616
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:30,147
Yoko Uehara Thank you, thank you, thank you. I haven't arrived yet.

617
00:03:30,147 --> 00:03:45,044
Alien Alien.

618
00:03:45,044 --> 00:04:00,117
I should go back. There are still 13 copies left.

619
00:04:00,117 --> 00:04:15,129
It's the last one. There is no public bath in the near future. I can't hit it.

620
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:30,157
Etchu. Where is the rice?

621
00:04:30,157 --> 00:04:45,116
This is a cake that has passed a little.

622
00:04:45,116 --> 00:05:00,096
You're calling.

623
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:15,043
I feel.

624
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:30,093
This too. I'm watching.

625
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:45,119
Tell me when you go.

626
00:05:45,119 --> 00:06:30,118
Want to cry. But don't open anything.

627
00:06:30,118 --> 00:06:45,128
I'll leave it to you at home.

628
00:06:45,128 --> 00:07:00,143
Call this.

629
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:15,120
Wait a minute. I see, it's okay.

630
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:30,132
go. I'm really sorry.

631
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:45,104
The one who can read this.

632
00:07:45,104 --> 00:08:00,153
Nitori Hirakata store.

633
00:08:00,153 --> 00:08:15,100
The battery that is sold from inside the house.

634
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:45,128
Times Cup.

635
00:08:45,128 --> 00:09:00,087
Well Chiharu is waiting.

636
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:15,096
I definitely want to borrow this.

637
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:30,127
I've never done it. It's not here.

638
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:45,139
Well then, I'm hey, it's tough because there are only 34 in total. Not so much.

639
00:09:45,139 --> 00:10:00,090
I can go I can definitely go.

640
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:30,106
I'm coming out.

641
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:45,144
Somehow under the parasol.

642
00:10:45,144 --> 00:11:00,083
Entrust. I messed up the car 00.

643
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:30,041
You can go.

644
00:11:30,041 --> 00:12:00,090
Insanely. I think it was a good match that I did my best.

645
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:15,140
I couldn't put it out. It smelled like gas.

646
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:30,138
I made a lot of money, so 632. 722 or less than 7 people.

647
00:12:30,138 --> 00:12:45,135
The last match. Also the powerful that was caught.

648
00:12:45,135 --> 00:13:00,148
Hatena sold a little, wasn't it? It was a little different at home. I think it wouldn't be strange to sell the front one at all.

649
00:13:00,148 --> 00:13:15,101
Yeah it was a really good fight.

650
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:30,068
Is the result announced?

651
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:45,092
I was impatient, but it was the best. It didn't feel like a nice fight at all. Speaking of rain.

652
00:13:45,092 --> 00:14:00,149
If you should take Horizon, I'll say it normally. To fly.

653
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:15,061
It was hot.

654
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:30,141
Come back. I wonder if I had a really good fight at the end.

655
00:14:30,141 --> 00:14:45,128
I have a request form. You can listen calmly.

656
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,142
It was a drum that waited only for the last time and answered that.

657
00:00:15,142 --> 00:00:30,114
If it's worth believing, by then. It seems that my child went a lot, but here.

658
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:45,089
6 years Ninety-nine didn't make sense. It's amazing.

659
00:00:45,089 --> 00:01:15,114
It's not so much at home.

660
00:01:15,114 --> 00:01:45,116
It was fun It was fun.

661
00:01:45,116 --> 00:02:00,089
I still want to do more-I still have something to do.

662
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:15,140
I wish I had it after it was over. But I'm sorry, I'm sorry. What is it really?

663
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:30,150
I told them this, but I really want to deliver it. Tomorrow Al-san and many-kun.

664
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:45,152
I'm proud of Tanaka I'm not handsome. From that time.

665
00:02:45,152 --> 00:03:00,122
Even if it's good. It's a little more that there are so many improvements. This is what I'm saying right now.

666
00:03:00,122 --> 00:03:15,169
You might wonder why you see this kind of bullying, but this is it.

667
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:30,138
If you think it's a party, C-mail it. Someone who can pick you up.

668
00:03:30,138 --> 00:03:45,147
So I thought it was growing. I think I was saying.

669
00:03:45,147 --> 00:04:00,185
I made it strict. A lot of memory Thank you to both of us for your help. What do you say me.

670
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:15,113
It's different if you just get out.

671
00:04:15,113 --> 00:04:30,116
The strongest, stupid.

672
00:04:30,116 --> 00:04:45,110
It was exactly what Kun said, but I could do more. You can also change maps.

673
00:04:45,110 --> 00:05:00,112
Amo. It's an order because I had to do it the most.

674
00:05:00,112 --> 00:05:15,134
Something. He really trusted me so much.

675
00:05:15,134 --> 00:05:30,134
But even a messed up manager. A talent manager is a manager.

676
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:45,154
What are you worried about? I was told a lot about it.

677
00:05:45,154 --> 00:06:00,124
So I'm playing after saying it first. You can't learn something like pulling. this time.

678
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:15,143
I knew it all the time, and I said I wanted to go out too.

679
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:30,158
I have already decided on a mountain from the stage when this tournament was called. I definitely want a certain person who has been replaced.

680
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:45,104
Good luck, I'm sorry for that too.

681
00:06:45,104 --> 00:07:00,160
I thought I was glad I knew it, but he also did a room that I thought was a coach. I have to go there already. Orikasa You really did it tomorrow without saying anything.

682
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:15,073
He really took the time. Thank you so much because I felt messed up. Until the very end.

683
00:07:15,073 --> 00:07:30,113
The growth is really amazing, so I really like it the most.

684
00:07:30,113 --> 00:07:45,047
I wonder if I put it in the rack. Because I got stronger but both of them got stronger.

685
00:07:45,047 --> 00:08:00,146
Forgetfulness also becomes stronger.

686
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:15,159
The night turn was strong Who was everyone who was strong?

687
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:30,142
Thank you for joining us and thank you for fighting with us.

688
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:45,124
You can go. I received it because I had a new stand.

689
00:08:45,124 --> 00:09:00,137
I don't know what Kira-kun is today.

690
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:15,095
That's why it's no good now. Some people did the same thing.

691
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:30,136
But don't be discouraged by that. Finally, seriously, he went. Thank you so much for letting me stand on this stage.

692
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:45,131
It was really a month's serious stumbling block. During.

693
00:09:45,131 --> 00:10:00,130
It wasn't broken all the time. Something up to here.

694
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:15,094
Yeah I think it was good. It hurts.

695
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:30,134
I'll do my best for the past month. I think it's wonderful If you're in love with this member, you're probably in love.

696
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:45,130
Shimada The same ointment as last time.

697
00:10:45,130 --> 00:11:30,089
Hikari gravure.

698
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:45,110
But after all everyone.

699
00:11:45,110 --> 00:12:00,101
I think we can go, but we aim seriously. Because the flow is correct.

700
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:15,154
It's only 20 minutes I want to be there at all. It wasn't too bad in the first half.

701
00:12:15,154 --> 00:12:30,130
What is the meaning of this flower?

702
00:12:30,130 --> 00:13:00,163
This time it's from a timing that really doesn't seem like anything. I don't think it was collected. Three people.

703
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:15,142
It came out the most air so far.

704
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:30,107
Tell me a lot. I intended to do it.

705
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:45,130
No, I did enough. Mint is strong.

706
00:13:45,130 --> 00:14:00,144
I think the potential of silane has come out, really today. I didn't.

707
00:14:00,144 --> 00:14:15,092
I wonder if it's the best.

708
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:30,136
I was able to put out a middle distance. Look, bring it.

709
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:45,145
Yakult really watched me for a month.

710
00:14:45,145 --> 00:15:00,174
Honesty Boil a lot in Avex.

711
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,134
Please take a look. I lied tomorrow.

712
00:00:15,134 --> 00:00:30,121
The soba restaurant that I really do. It's pink though. seriously.

713
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:45,105
Somehow that. The amount of work I have to do tomorrow.

714
00:00:45,105 --> 00:01:00,242
Predator I'm right. Hey, I can't do that.

715
00:01:00,242 --> 00:01:15,267
Personally, I think I had hit a certain person. In such a situation, what's going on with that?

716
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:30,147
Even though I'm bad, the enemy got along well with me.

717
00:01:30,147 --> 00:01:45,235
No, that's really it. Dick team.

718
00:01:45,235 --> 00:02:00,224
You can't win. Everyone is feeling sick.

719
00:02:00,224 --> 00:02:15,112
It's a drug. Let's manage your physical condition well.

720
00:02:15,112 --> 00:02:30,272
I'm sorry if I become a master. Maybe it's a line. Then maybe they were teaming up separately.

721
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:45,290
Let's do it by dragging. I'm sorry we're going tomorrow. 1 Diamond is already over par, so it's no good. It's a cup to do.

722
00:02:45,290 --> 00:03:00,124
That's okay. You have to be a celebrity.

723
00:03:00,124 --> 00:03:15,139
Let's do our best because it's still open to the public for the future life If it's really fun, this is it. The 123rd race in the early stages that was dead at the stage.

724
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:30,092
It was fun and affordable at all. Definitely to the end.

725
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:45,089
2000 more tours I want. Estro Lab.

726
00:03:45,089 --> 00:04:00,137
Then I'll type it in. Would you like to go between the galleries? I'm seriously scraping everything and looking for 100,000.

727
00:04:00,137 --> 00:04:15,044
For the time being.

728
00:04:15,044 --> 00:04:30,133
Thank you for your support. Thank you. I think I will be 9 years old.

729
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:45,126
Probably it is planned to start with.

730
00:04:45,126 --> 00:05:00,157
So. Yes Yes Should I wait for a while? Should I talk about it?

731
00:05:00,157 --> 00:05:15,143
Where should I look at the band? that's right.

732
00:05:15,143 --> 00:05:30,159
It was really stable. Kusu stronger.

733
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:45,135
I'll be stronger. It seems that only alsa can do it.

734
00:05:45,135 --> 00:06:00,160
That's why I decided to do it from the hand that is no longer standard, but there is also the next one.

735
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:15,136
Thank you very much if you really make a thread from there. This is really no good.

736
00:06:15,136 --> 00:06:30,121
But I think I could say it as much as I wanted. No, it was wonderful. If you enjoyed it.

737
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:45,188
I think it was as fun as when I was playing around casually. .. Everybody is here and there.

738
00:06:45,188 --> 00:07:00,145
I'm glad it was cheap. Hulu.

739
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:15,131
Is it time to nominate? It will be three minutes later.

740
00:07:15,131 --> 00:07:30,130
Please look at the mute. The shape of the frame of the two. Here I am embraced. Thank you. Yes. 8.

741
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:45,186
About 3 minutes I'm talking to everyone. Is it useless without it?

742
00:07:45,186 --> 00:08:00,112
I'm talking for the week. It's simple, like becoming a college student. It's cute, isn't it?

743
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:15,156
It's time to shoot on LINE, isn't it?

744
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:30,136
There are no other distributions, for example, chatting, and I'm a little bit. There is also singing, so maybe that person too. I think it was there.

745
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:45,153
Well, I don't think it caused that lonely trouble to everyone, but I'm lonely.

746
00:08:45,153 --> 00:09:00,143
Thank you very much and a lot of support. Maybe a comment. But even so, there are still a lot of things. I don't know if there is a big difference in the atmosphere, but he made various comments.

747
00:09:00,143 --> 00:09:15,153
Bell, more and more, you see, I'm also doing this kind of activity, Holosters quite AP.

748
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:30,130
Well, even if it's just a little, if it spreads, it depends on how I do it, so I'm really grateful to everyone. Please see the delivery again.
