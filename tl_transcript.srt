00:00:00,000 --> 01:53:15,971
Good evening everyone, in charge of the live system for a lifetime. Everyone's idol. ToDay.

2
01:53:15,971 --> 01:53:30,880
Let's make a sound of Pat life. Just outside the delivery. Mountain science.

3
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:45,871
I want to see the uncertain bamboo grass of the operation.

4
01:53:45,871 --> 01:54:00,842
In the first place, I don't know how to store this weapon, and I don't know how to store it. It's really bad.

5
01:54:00,842 --> 01:54:15,868
Joy-Con I think Joy-Con is injured.

6
01:54:15,868 --> 01:54:30,873
Alberto Yes Yes Yes Yes. Really.

7
01:54:30,873 --> 01:54:45,908
It 's dangerous, is n't it? It 's really sweet.

8
01:54:45,908 --> 01:55:00,832
this. It's really completely different.

9
01:55:00,832 --> 01:55:15,894
I like it. This is already.

10
01:55:15,894 --> 01:55:30,874
Where do you play? I don't feel like Maruko-chan is playing.

11
01:55:30,874 --> 01:55:45,883
And what about love ZIP?

12
01:55:45,883 --> 01:56:00,864
Take it out here. But hey.

13
01:56:00,864 --> 01:56:15,860
Chawanmushi song.

14
01:56:15,860 --> 01:56:30,873
bronze. The Punicon specification isn't over a millimeter, because the people who are crazy are amazing.

15
01:56:30,873 --> 01:56:45,874
I have a bad dog.

16
01:56:45,874 --> 01:57:00,855
Try a short distance. The short distance still hits.

17
01:57:00,855 --> 01:57:15,790
Are you okay.

18
01:57:15,790 --> 01:57:30,841
It's dangerous to make a mistake in Cocoon.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 01:57:47,745
Mr. Matsui Controllers.

20
01:57:47,745 --> 01:58:02,752
Would you like to go once? Weapons cannot be switched. Where is it?

21
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:17,717
Where is the qualification on the outer wall? Do you do your best?

22
01:58:17,717 --> 01:58:32,710
Try it once or casually. I have to worry about Kirle.

23
01:58:32,710 --> 01:58:47,729
Taiheiso.

24
01:58:47,729 --> 01:59:02,762
I'm trying to shoot a gun with the black circle button. This is Kim.

25
01:59:02,762 --> 01:59:17,744
The message does not come. I'm Lelele.

26
01:59:17,744 --> 01:59:32,748
Move the edge while crouching.

27
01:59:32,748 --> 01:59:47,753
You won't be able to press the round button or something. You won't crouch.

28
01:59:47,753 --> 02:00:17,751
You did your best.

29
02:00:17,751 --> 02:00:32,894
Let's do it How do you get back to the original place? Return to the lobby. It's not a round button Ah, I'll stay three more.

30
02:00:32,894 --> 02:00:47,665
Let's do our best.

31
02:00:47,665 --> 02:01:02,716
A brand account is better. thus.

32
02:01:02,716 --> 02:01:17,719
At 4.

33
02:01:17,719 --> 02:01:47,770
I'll do my best. Please note. I will use the cut for the first time.

34
02:01:47,770 --> 02:02:17,723
Good luck to meet you even though you are lucky.

35
02:02:17,723 --> 02:02:32,753
I'm hoping that the average damage killle will go down.

36
02:02:32,753 --> 02:02:47,752
It looks like you can come down where there are no enemies. OK.

37
02:02:47,752 --> 02:03:02,721
How do you do it?

38
02:03:02,721 --> 02:03:17,749
Good luck with me.

39
02:03:17,749 --> 02:03:47,741
There was a Spitfire. Himrock. Do you open the book?

40
02:03:47,741 --> 02:04:02,733
with this. How to throw away the punishment. Qualification for de-steering.

41
02:04:02,733 --> 02:04:17,662
nearby.

42
02:04:17,662 --> 02:04:32,700
It's a baby. Let's keep up with them.

43
02:04:32,700 --> 02:05:02,726
It's enough to have 10.

44
02:05:02,726 --> 02:05:17,718
It keeps moving forward.

45
02:05:17,718 --> 02:05:47,729
Cow pattern 8.

46
02:05:47,729 --> 02:06:02,755
Somehow a weapon came out.

47
02:06:02,755 --> 02:06:17,725
Even the enemy. Will it be?

48
02:06:17,725 --> 02:06:32,745
this is. That's right. Call out.

49
02:06:32,745 --> 02:06:47,774
Even one person is just a corpse. A moving corpse now. Are you ready for the end?

50
02:06:47,774 --> 02:07:02,789
At the end. I'm planning to go back to the final 10 teams for an hour, and sing a song that says it's always like this.

51
02:07:02,789 --> 02:07:17,733
I'm excited about it.

52
02:07:17,733 --> 02:07:32,754
Search for enemies. I have to be awake.

53
02:07:32,754 --> 02:07:47,729
I feel like I'm here. Sasha.

54
02:07:47,729 --> 02:08:02,738
Physics is impossible, the best. Usually still.

55
02:08:02,738 --> 02:08:17,749
If you don't need it, don't help. I want you to be a Sukiya.

56
02:08:17,749 --> 02:08:32,752
That guy.

57
02:08:32,752 --> 02:08:47,756
8th place dentistry. I want that.

58
02:08:47,756 --> 02:09:02,734
Beyond this. It's like a new car. Tomorrow dentist.

59
02:09:02,734 --> 02:09:17,736
Do you get it. What should I do all night?

60
02:09:17,736 --> 02:09:47,725
How crush.

61
02:09:47,725 --> 02:10:32,714
It may be good, I don't know how to recover.

62
02:10:32,714 --> 02:11:32,717
How to use the part.

63
02:11:32,717 --> 02:11:47,723
This is bronze. How to turn off vibration.

64
02:11:47,723 --> 02:12:02,734
How do you do it? Is it a vibration off controller?

65
02:12:02,734 --> 02:12:17,745
Of the controller. Lower vibration Is this?

66
02:12:17,745 --> 02:12:32,768
This is the reality pad is really the range on the first day.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 02:12:49,703
That good evening. first.

68
02:12:49,703 --> 02:13:04,728
We apologize for the inconvenience.

69
02:13:04,728 --> 02:13:19,740
No assistance from the PC. Come on because it's connected. I don't know if there is no assist.

70
02:13:19,740 --> 02:13:34,708
This time I got it right.

71
02:13:34,708 --> 02:13:49,704
Isn't it hostile?

72
02:13:49,704 --> 02:14:04,711
First catch. Flat line.

73
02:14:04,711 --> 02:14:19,745
When I saw it from a friend who was probably a cholo at the festival. Yeah.

74
02:14:19,745 --> 02:14:34,705
I can use it from tomorrow.

75
02:14:34,705 --> 02:14:49,753
How do you use your weapon? It's OK.

76
02:14:49,753 --> 02:15:04,703
Let's go see the beacon.

77
02:15:04,703 --> 02:15:34,728
listen. I'm watching it with a great one.

78
02:15:34,728 --> 02:16:19,728
Forget even that ability. 7 is far away.

79
02:16:19,728 --> 02:16:49,693
Thank you for your request. Free of 9.

80
02:16:49,693 --> 02:17:19,730
I'm doing it. Get out of the enemy from behind.

81
02:17:19,730 --> 02:17:34,682
Soranone.

82
02:17:34,682 --> 02:17:49,731
I'll play around here. Fortune-telling. There is a battery.

83
02:17:49,731 --> 02:18:04,686
I've come to the festival and live a little longer.

84
02:18:04,686 --> 02:18:19,712
The game behind the Risa Muzui cat.

85
02:18:19,712 --> 02:18:34,723
There is a syringe.

86
02:18:34,723 --> 02:18:49,751
Are you going It 's good.

87
02:18:49,751 --> 02:19:04,721
It happened to happen.

88
02:19:04,721 --> 02:19:19,637
how is it.

89
02:19:19,637 --> 02:19:34,712
How are you looking at the map?

90
02:19:34,712 --> 02:20:04,743
The middle is really a rare shotgun bolt.

91
02:20:04,743 --> 02:20:19,729
this is. When will you come?

92
02:20:19,729 --> 02:20:34,694
Something happened.

93
02:20:34,694 --> 02:20:49,688
I opened it. Please come by car.

94
02:20:49,688 --> 02:21:19,690
Ueda.

95
02:21:19,690 --> 02:21:34,688
Take a peek.

96
02:21:34,688 --> 02:21:49,693
8 Grenades. Grenade.

97
02:21:49,693 --> 02:22:49,816
By chance.

98
02:22:49,816 --> 02:23:04,733
grandmother. Damage decent.

99
02:23:04,733 --> 02:23:19,705
It's embarrassing. But in the first place, it's really down.

100
02:23:19,705 --> 02:23:34,767
The 400 average was 440, but it went down to 29.

101
02:23:34,767 --> 02:23:49,718
It has dropped by about 0.2. Actually. Acknowledged.

102
02:23:49,718 --> 02:24:04,721
I may have approved my friend I'm sorry I don't even know the block. Let's do our best. Demachi Key Mau's ability.

103
02:24:04,721 --> 02:24:19,724
Feeling pad nutrition. That's it. Good evening.

104
02:24:19,724 --> 02:24:34,693
I'm using Pat.

105
02:24:34,693 --> 02:24:49,689
What should I do? I will call you.

106
02:24:49,689 --> 02:25:04,638
Thank you very much.

107
02:25:04,638 --> 02:25:19,733
friendly. Summer color festival of Saga false eyelashes.

108
02:25:19,733 --> 02:25:34,724
Let's go.

109
02:25:34,724 --> 02:26:04,694
The current situation was Key Mau.

110
02:26:04,694 --> 02:26:34,697
Come on.

111
02:26:34,697 --> 02:27:04,714
Rice ball game. I'm on top.

112
02:27:04,714 --> 02:27:19,727
I don't know, though. if.

113
02:27:19,727 --> 02:27:34,708
The pierced earrings have fallen.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 02:27:51,743
My visibility is good. What should I do.

115
02:27:51,743 --> 02:28:21,777
How do you get out?

116
02:28:21,777 --> 02:28:36,682
8.

117
02:28:36,682 --> 02:28:51,767
The battle of friends is not over yet.

118
02:28:51,767 --> 02:29:06,677
what will you do.

119
02:29:06,677 --> 02:29:51,682
Good luck.

120
02:29:51,682 --> 02:30:36,749
Let's go wake up.

121
02:30:36,749 --> 02:30:51,737
Go to wake up. The festival is. History History.

122
02:30:51,737 --> 02:31:06,769
Wake up here.

123
02:31:06,769 --> 02:31:21,778
This person is funny. What did you say.

124
02:31:21,778 --> 02:31:36,767
The horse is bad.

125
02:31:36,767 --> 02:31:51,844
It's very toothy.

126
02:31:51,844 --> 02:32:06,761
It's noon.

127
02:32:06,761 --> 02:32:21,766
Patna. I'm living a pat life. It was kind of boring, though.

128
02:32:21,766 --> 02:32:36,751
It's hard to get rid of it.

129
02:32:36,751 --> 02:33:06,694
Reload.

130
02:33:06,694 --> 02:33:51,751
I'm quiet.

131
02:33:51,751 --> 02:34:06,796
Do your best, do your best, do your best.

132
02:34:06,796 --> 02:34:21,756
I'm sorry. It was amazing.

133
02:34:21,756 --> 02:34:36,744
It's tough, but do your best, look 600.

134
02:34:36,744 --> 02:34:51,749
It's fun but it's the best. It will be handed over in the rain. I'll do DV. Make this a wrap.

135
02:34:51,749 --> 02:35:21,800
It's just a little at the end. Easy to put away.

136
02:35:21,800 --> 02:35:36,763
The typhoon is terrible. Wait a minute and pull this out.

137
02:35:36,763 --> 02:35:51,803
I'll use fat.

138
02:35:51,803 --> 02:36:06,746
First of all, the percentage of leaders who cannot go. Isn't it cute? This is written.

139
02:36:06,746 --> 02:36:21,748
85 of 19 K. Look at it.

140
02:36:21,748 --> 02:36:36,752
Get off at all.

141
02:36:36,752 --> 02:36:51,795
Great! Great. It's been a long time.

142
02:36:51,795 --> 02:37:06,752
I think I can be either.

143
02:37:06,752 --> 02:37:21,705
10 years.

144
02:37:21,705 --> 02:37:36,747
The way to play is different.

145
02:37:36,747 --> 02:37:51,773
Let's go Let's go. The feeling hasn't come back yet.

146
02:37:51,773 --> 02:38:06,772
I still have a feeling.

147
02:38:06,772 --> 02:38:21,810
What happened. Will you give it? I don't have a bag.

148
02:38:21,810 --> 02:38:36,776
It's over, kill or kill.

149
02:38:36,776 --> 02:38:51,743
Dazzling and weak.

150
02:38:51,743 --> 02:39:06,750
Let's go Something like them.

151
02:39:06,750 --> 02:39:21,743
No.

152
02:39:21,743 --> 02:39:36,793
It is impossible to call this a putt.

153
02:39:36,793 --> 02:40:06,766
Tax-free. There is no shaking.

154
02:40:06,766 --> 02:40:36,724
I'm hit.

155
02:40:36,724 --> 02:41:06,741
Regain summer color.

156
02:41:06,741 --> 02:41:21,786
Then it's no good, maybe the feeling is too cute.

157
02:41:21,786 --> 02:41:36,798
It's a stream.

158
02:41:36,798 --> 02:41:51,775
It's not something I can do. Is it the best?

159
02:41:51,775 --> 02:42:06,765
It's a little different than before.

160
02:42:06,765 --> 02:42:21,804
First of all, it's different. I think it's different. The last is decided, not the cold misogi. Let's do it.

161
02:42:21,804 --> 02:42:36,733
It's a myth.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 02:43:08,695
Tokyo steamed bun.

163
02:43:08,695 --> 02:43:38,691
I'll be waiting for you.

164
02:43:38,691 --> 02:43:53,589
No different no

165
02:43:53,589 --> 02:44:08,663
Is it because it is damaged?

166
02:44:08,663 --> 02:44:38,686
OK. I'm crazy over here.

167
02:44:38,686 --> 02:44:53,646
Avex is simple. If it was Pat, it would have been at all.

168
02:44:53,646 --> 02:45:08,666
The tip.

169
02:45:08,666 --> 02:45:23,641
I don't even have Energia.

170
02:45:23,641 --> 02:45:38,672
Sneak up from behind.

171
02:45:38,672 --> 02:46:08,721
That's bad. Wait a minute, wait for a comment.

172
02:46:08,721 --> 02:46:23,695
Yoko-chan I don't want to fight.

173
02:46:23,695 --> 02:46:38,661
Because it feels bad.

174
02:46:38,661 --> 02:47:08,681
I have no choice but to go.

175
02:47:08,681 --> 02:47:23,679
About 3. It's serious, but it's not cool at all, though.

176
02:47:23,679 --> 02:47:38,670
Are you looking at the listener? I have seen it for three years.

177
02:47:38,670 --> 02:47:53,699
For the first time in my life. I don't know if I'm in a hurry, but I'm sorry.

178
02:47:53,699 --> 02:48:08,634
Is this good?

179
02:48:08,634 --> 02:48:23,660
A monkey who watches the game because he is loved. There is snow on the rim.

180
02:48:23,660 --> 02:48:38,599
Mobile phone.

181
02:48:38,599 --> 02:49:23,635
You can come from either side even if you fight. A delicate place.

182
02:49:23,635 --> 02:49:38,686
I'm not sure, but when there aren't many.

183
02:49:38,686 --> 02:50:08,691
It's different from the time of the previous putt.

184
02:50:08,691 --> 02:50:23,698
The bullishness is different. It's a great cut to exchange for seafood because it's said that it's not a cut right now.

185
02:50:23,698 --> 02:50:38,644
The putt is over. with this.

186
02:50:38,644 --> 02:50:53,683
If you say this, keep watching it on the distribution screen.

187
02:50:53,683 --> 02:51:08,659
What, what, what. Was fooled.

188
02:51:08,659 --> 02:51:53,691
I want to do it.

189
02:51:53,691 --> 02:52:08,672
If you want to do it, let's go.

190
02:52:08,672 --> 02:52:23,683
I'm okay with this 7 years old. 7 The stage is sunny.

191
02:52:23,683 --> 02:52:38,658
After all, maybe more.

192
02:52:38,658 --> 02:53:53,653
A kimono from a very old house.

193
02:53:53,653 --> 02:54:08,659
What should I do?

194
02:54:08,659 --> 02:54:23,607
Itchy nose.

195
02:54:23,607 --> 02:55:08,642
It's annoying on Machida.

196
02:55:08,642 --> 02:55:23,661
The photo is not bad. Catch a grain.

197
02:55:23,661 --> 02:55:38,599

198
02:55:38,599 --> 02:55:53,696

I wake it up.

200
02:56:38,669 --> 02:56:53,663
Okoshite Okoshite Okoshite.

201
02:56:53,663 --> 02:57:38,627
Because it makes me shiny. Hey wrong.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 02:57:55,636
I changed to a wilderness team. Who was it? It was delicious.

203
02:57:55,636 --> 02:58:25,626
Thank you very much. The toilet seems to have revived the race trying to do so. No, that ult.

204
02:58:25,626 --> 02:58:40,587
I respect you without permission.

205
02:58:40,587 --> 02:58:55,651
I was strong There was one announcement here tomorrow. Do you know

206
02:58:55,651 --> 02:59:10,618
Yes. Because it will come out.

Thank you. I was invited because I was supposed to leave. Because he invited me.

208
02:59:25,580 --> 02:59:40,653
I was so tired that I was angry when I said that it would be Paca **.

209
02:59:40,653 --> 02:59:55,635
It's the worst. Good luck and good luck.

03:00:25,649 --> 03:00:40,646
While consulting there. There is also a song frame.

Thank you for your hard work. I found out that the people who can use Yana Pack are amazing today. It feels like Jagarico. It was Warota.

216
03:01:55,637 --> 03:02:10,646
Only Mastiff, who may be a good friendship for Pat, won. I will read it one by one.
