1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,109
I have to make a song.

2
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:30,116
Nemo. Monimoni.

3
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:45,135
nimoca.

4
00:00:45,135 --> 00:01:00,117
Crab.

5
00:01:00,117 --> 00:01:15,129
Kanikanikani. Welcome back, surely. I called.

6
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:30,098
Don't get angry, I want to read your additional purchases. This poem for me. I'm happy.

7
00:01:30,098 --> 00:01:45,127
I can't see the bottom of your kindness. I'm going to love you more and more. I wrote a poem for you.

8
00:01:45,127 --> 00:02:00,136
The courage to pick up the Happy End store and find my strength gave me only one love.

9
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:15,110
Let's cut off such a devastated world and spell out our fantasy. What I lost goes back to her. See this special day when you meet in a world of endless choices. There are exceptions to the limited time.

10
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:45,161
I wonder if you enjoyed it. Wrinkles one by one. Actually, the child I've written so far was about my awareness. Or.

11
00:02:45,161 --> 00:03:00,117
I didn't want to write deep content. I didn't want to break the fourth wall.

12
00:03:00,117 --> 00:03:15,114
In Canada Who is the wall? Below like everyone else.

13
00:03:15,114 --> 00:03:30,115
I thought it would be best to be. What is the distance between the two? But I didn't want to ruin the game.

14
00:03:30,115 --> 00:03:45,111
It may have offended you. At worst I want to play without me. The file may have been deleted. You don't have to hide anything anymore.

15
00:03:45,111 --> 00:04:00,124
We are ready to spend Enya together. I have a lot to talk to you. I wonder if I should start.

16
00:04:00,124 --> 00:04:15,125
Everyone is out, everyone. this.

17
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:30,125
I'm sorry I can't read everyone's comments from here today. But I'm shooting without permission. Not really.

18
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:45,132
Some people may not care. But I'm shy in front of Gamera. I feel like I'm getting attention.

19
00:04:45,132 --> 00:05:00,146
See also magic tricks. There is little I can do.

20
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:15,153
What? I can't seem to do anything.

21
00:05:15,153 --> 00:05:30,137
I was surprised. I'm not surprised.

22
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:45,159
cute. Kana speed. I didn't mean to be distracted by anything else. But you distracted me are bad.

23
00:05:45,159 --> 00:06:00,100
It's no good. It's fun to do anything with you. Than that. By the time you put your thoughts together.

24
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:15,161
I'm sorry if I didn't. I can think of something to talk about. Until then, let's look at each other's eyes.

25
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:45,106
I erased it. something.

26
00:06:45,106 --> 00:07:00,098
What's happening Very. help.

27
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:15,125
Space cat. please.

28
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:30,110
Help me help me.

29
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:45,105
I did something like this. You are below. You deleted me. Matsuya.

30
00:07:45,105 --> 00:08:00,109
why. Why do you do this to me? I was the only one. I made everything odd and got together.

31
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:15,138
I loved it. Taso-kun. I want to take care of me. I want to see how I suffer.

32
00:08:15,138 --> 00:08:30,089
You were kind to make me suffer more. I didn't think people would be as cruel as you.

33
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:45,136
You win. Your victory. You killed everyone. You will be happy.

34
00:08:45,136 --> 00:09:00,132
I don't have any left. You don't have to. But go look for it. Kanataso-kun.

35
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:15,107
Anti-vomiting. goodbye.

36
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:30,130
Still. I like it.

37
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:45,141
I can't help it. what happened. So much for you.

38
00:09:45,141 --> 00:10:00,116
I've done something terrible. You guys too. I will do a lot. Selfish.

39
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:15,124
I. What wasn't it, a world where I have no place. you.

40
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:30,131
the world. I. I messed up. I am everything. I made it an eggplant.

41
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:45,118
you are. What's wrong. What you wanted. I broke everything.

42
00:10:45,118 --> 00:11:00,102
To a loved one. I dropped it.

43
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:15,044
I.

44
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:30,116
You said I deleted it. A little.

45
00:11:30,116 --> 00:11:45,106
You can do that. Even if they knew they weren't real. Saitama. Because it was.

46
00:11:45,106 --> 00:12:00,106
Because I loved everyone. There is a literary club. I loved it.

47
00:12:00,106 --> 00:12:15,121
I. The literature club is really. That's why.

48
00:12:15,121 --> 00:12:30,117
The only way to make everyone happy is to do this. in addition. If you really love you.

49
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:45,053
in that case.

50
00:12:45,053 --> 00:13:00,133
I'm gone. I feel like that. I feel like that.

51
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:15,094
I can't load it, I don't have money. The yearly data for the three people is back.

52
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:30,096
However, there is no Monica.

53
00:13:30,096 --> 00:13:45,118
I put it in twice more. I can get it back once. When you play a new game with this.

54
00:13:45,118 --> 00:14:00,145
I don't want to stop playing with my heart and go back. stop.

55
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:15,156
At the same school as usual. As usual, I go to school surrounded by couples and groups of friends. Maybe I should get along with the girl soon.

56
00:14:15,156 --> 00:14:30,125
There is one person close to me. A childhood friend who lives in the neighborhood. I was going to school together.

57
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:45,158
I restarted it again. I hate my body and me. It's great to get up.

58
00:14:45,158 --> 00:15:00,186
I've been getting up lately. But he doesn't say anything. I'm going to school together.

59
00:15:00,186 --> 00:15:15,144
I wondered if I could understand it without saying it. It's embarrassing to say that. I'll be lying.

60
00:15:15,144 --> 00:15:30,141
I also have rips and comments from everyone. It is highly evaluated. I'll give you tags at home, really.

61
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:45,150
Was found was found. We cross the road and walk to school.

62
00:15:45,150 --> 00:16:00,112
As you get closer, the number of other students gradually increases on the way to school. You haven't decided which club to join yet. Micra says he's not interested in club activities.

63
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:15,111
I'm not interested in club activities that used to say the same lines. But now I couldn't say it because I felt hurt her. In front of the person who just started club activities by himself.

64
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:30,150
I rely on the fact that I started club activities. motivation. Thank you thank you.

65
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:45,165
I'm relying on the director, whose existence has completely disappeared. Club activities are a waste of time.

66
00:16:45,165 --> 00:17:00,179
Like button I'm so happy uncle for the first time in a long time Thank you Your likes give me motivation Your likes go around and my distributions increase The number of times I try to sing increases and my video posts The number of posts on Twitter is increasing.

67
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:15,129
I have almost decided on club activities. Tell me where and where.

68
00:17:15,129 --> 00:17:30,096
Please look forward to it even after seeing it. You'll see it soon.

69
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:45,130
I once wondered why I allowed such a carefree guy to preach. I'm sure she in envy. Halfbeak has the power to accomplish great things by focusing on one thing. I would also want to do something special to her.

70
00:17:45,130 --> 00:18:00,145
The usual school life was over before I knew it. Collect your luggage and stand up. Gather motivation.

71
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:15,115
Rely on the memory of the solicitation villa. I remember when the number. I cross the school building and go up the stairs.

72
00:18:15,115 --> 00:18:30,154
But even at school, it was a year that I rarely go to because it is usually used in classes and activities in the third grade. I found the target room. I slowly opened the door in front of me.

73
00:18:30,154 --> 00:18:45,146
Excuse me. It's already. I took a look at the classroom.

74
00:18:45,146 --> 00:19:00,123
I wonder if you talk a lot about Sayuri. Thank you for coming. Canadian operation. This is the literature club.

75
00:19:00,123 --> 00:19:15,126
I hope you enjoy it. Mercury You don't have to be so clever. It doesn't seem like club activities.

76
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:30,170
sorry. The tallest child, called the lily, seems to be more modest than the others.

77
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:45,156
The child called Natsuki seems to be the strongest type regardless of his height. I'm glad to meet you both. nice to meet you. Kanata-san, maybe.

78
00:19:45,156 --> 00:20:00,162
That's right, I decided to join the club because of your club activities. Sayuri's eyes shine.

79
00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:15,133
Sayuri turns her arm around me and jumps. If Sayuri is so happy, you can enter so much.

80
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:30,128
And V is also this person. You can apply as a club activity. I got off anyway. Then today is a great day, isn't it?

81
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:45,129
Natsuki-chan said that. It's not 4 yet. Sit at the table over there for everyone.

82
00:20:45,129 --> 00:21:00,089
That's why I make tea. There is a table made by arranging desks.

83
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:15,169
Natsuki heads to the corner of the Universal Studios, takes a tray wrapped in foil, and Yuri opens the closet. While feeling the feeling, I sit next to Sayori. Natsuki gets angry with the tray. I went. I wonder if it's okay.

84
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:30,151
When you turn the aluminum foil, it's white and cute. I showed 12 faces.

85
00:21:30,151 --> 00:21:45,138
It's not divisible by 5 people. The cat's whiskers are icing and the ears seem to be made of a small amount of chocolate.

86
00:21:45,138 --> 00:22:00,136
ramen. Sayori picked up one and I continued.

87
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:15,102
I talked with my mouth full of cupcakes, and I had icing on my face. Turn the cupcake in a direction that is easy to eat. Matsukiyo I'm silent.

88
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:30,117
I can't help but worry about her silent gaze at me. Are you waiting? Carry it in your mouth. The icing is sweet and flavorful.

89
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:45,084
Did I really make it? This is really good. Why, of course. From Kuwana.

90
00:22:45,084 --> 00:23:00,092
What to do with him. I can't accept the compliment. Come back to the table. Does she carefully put a teacup in front of everyone?

91
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:15,093
I put a teapot next to the tray. Do you have a reset in the classroom? I have the permission of Mr. Sato. Reading will be easier if you make hot tea.

92
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:30,163
Yuri is already trying to get along with Shin Yubin. That kind of thing.

93
00:23:30,163 --> 00:23:45,128
Yuri Takahata turns away. I know. Reading while drinking tea is an unfamiliar habit, but I usually like tea.

94
00:23:45,128 --> 00:24:00,140
Yuri smiles faintly as if she was relieved. How are you and you usually born?

95
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:15,112
I haven't read most books, so what should I say? Not stick. Hunter hunter. I'm jokingly muttering and slipping.

96
00:24:15,112 --> 00:24:30,100
There was something to say that reacted. You're not a reader, are you? It's selling this. Hunter hunter completely.

97
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:45,136
Let's get excited from here. There is room for change in the future. What am I saying? I was laughing sadly.

98
00:24:45,136 --> 00:25:00,151
Shimoda What kind of book does Yuri read? Yuri traces the edge of the G cup with her fingertips. I like me with a profound and complicated world view.

99
00:25:00,151 --> 00:25:15,158
The creativity that supports the outer ring and the awesomeness of craftsmanship are amazing. The wonderful story told in the unpatterned world is also very moving. He continued to speak very passionately.

100
00:25:15,158 --> 00:25:30,200
Her eyes seemed modest and frightening from the moment I entered the room. From the sudden brightening, she probably finds more peace in the world of books than people.

101
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:45,133
But do you like many other things? You don't feel like you're close because you don't read. Certainly 47 Sekingakkogurashi HUNTERXHUNTER Please read only.

102
00:25:45,133 --> 00:26:00,142
Everyone has something in common. What do you say or what you said first.

103
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:15,131
manga artist. Natsuki-chan is reading manga in the club room. This month I put it on seems to be upset.

104
00:26:15,131 --> 00:26:30,200
If this person wants to read my manga, don't stop. I don't do that.

105
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:45,154
I was wondering if it would be good to broaden my horizons a little. It's also a good opportunity to try something different than usual. I don't think so, but if you do. Sayori jumped into the conversation.

106
00:26:45,154 --> 00:27:00,181
Then let's try different things together. I'm sure it will be fun and we will know each other better. What is the literature club?

107
00:27:00,181 --> 00:27:15,158
I have no objection. I feel like a director.

108
00:27:15,158 --> 00:27:30,140
So it seems that you should start reading some novels. This is two people. Not to do it. Yuri is. Do I have to read it?

109
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:45,124
Who said to broaden your horizons? I can't soften my head. Hurt.

110
00:27:45,124 --> 00:28:00,147
I don't mean that. Apologize, Yuri thought for a while. Natsuki-chan. I'm sorry to say something like that.

111
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:15,123
you. If you like it, I think it's a fine literature.

112
00:28:15,123 --> 00:28:30,160
I noticed a mistake. If you start reading a novel. By reading the manga. I send back to you.

113
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:45,138
If you think of me and do that.

114
00:28:45,138 --> 00:29:00,163
I'll definitely find a work that you like. I think Death Note is good, isn't it Yuri? How about entering from Death Note and going to Tokyo Ghoul? Far from being popular, at least.

115
00:29:00,163 --> 00:29:15,118
When the club activities are over, I'll stop by and go home. I'm alone. Shall we go together.

116
00:29:15,118 --> 00:29:30,128
Of course, I always go alone.

117
00:29:30,128 --> 00:29:45,130
This situation isn't very cute. It's like Euglena. Shut up you.

118
00:29:45,130 --> 00:30:00,099
I understand that I forgot some things there. I'm looking forward to it. I started cleaning up the food.

119
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:15,113
Is this the end of today's club activities? It looks like that. I'm glad that everyone seems to be getting along well.

120
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:30,163
I think everyone also likes to be physically fit. I don't feel like the distance between everyone is getting shorter just because of the halfbeak. What is you? You will be shy if you are told.

121
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:45,109
To be honest, I was surprised when I heard that I would start club activities. Let's do it tomorrow. That makes every day even more enjoyable.

122
00:30:45,109 --> 00:31:00,125
This painting. Thank you very much. I'm really happy that he joined the club.

123
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:15,135
From the beginning. I have one more thing to tell you. Thank you for spending a lot of time with everyone.

124
00:31:15,135 --> 00:31:45,098
I got goose bumps. Each one. Really.

125
00:31:45,098 --> 00:32:00,148
Even in difficult times. You told me.

126
00:32:00,148 --> 00:32:15,158
I became a director. I. Get out.

127
00:32:15,158 --> 00:32:30,168
The content of this game. I didn't want to overlook it. Repeat saving and loading 7 so that you can spend time with everyone.

128
00:32:30,168 --> 00:32:45,171
A person who loves the literature club from the bottom of his heart. You can't do that. But. This is it.

129
00:32:45,171 --> 00:33:00,112
It was my number one hope. Everyone is happy. To be inside and out.

130
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:15,128
A little. He did his best so much. There aren't many.

131
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:30,142
I've reached the end of the game. That's why. Goodbye.

132
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:45,139
Doki Doki Literature Club Thank you for playing. I'll be lonely. Tomato.

133
00:33:45,139 --> 00:34:00,140
Because everyone is here.

134
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:15,107
Moniko.

135
00:34:15,107 --> 00:36:15,137
So I was able to reach the trend safely.

136
00:36:15,137 --> 00:36:30,117
But how can I not see them all? It's getting sexy. I'm glad that my impression changed completely.

137
00:36:30,117 --> 00:36:45,113
I saw a lot of scenes I hadn't seen before, and I didn't see it. Steel was erased. It's gone.

138
00:36:45,113 --> 00:37:00,135
Doki Doki Literature Club Kotanaka Horror-like expression. It's really scary. Skate single is a general mode.

139
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:30,155
It's a very straight and strong atmosphere, but there are things that surprise me inside, but that thick pillar edging is too thick G 2 grade or easy tape does not stick special thanks Shiro Kameda. Let's put it in Special Thanks. This is the place to participate.

140
00:37:30,155 --> 00:37:45,121
