I took this without permission. I think there are 3 in all.

3
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:15,105
I still had hope if I proceeded little by little.

4
00:01:15,105 --> 00:01:30,123
I wonder if I only need the house key. I haven't overlooked anything. Is it true?

I'm curious about the room on the left. Whose room is this?

8
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:30,105
It's not a flower candle, but something else. Not an incense stick.

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:45,088
It's not the key. Isn't it somewhere good? I thought too much.

35
00:12:45,088 --> 00:13:00,243
Where to use it.

36
00:13:00,243 --> 00:13:15,104
