49
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:45,112
I wonder what to say.

50
00:02:45,112 --> 00:03:00,153
If it's Mercy, the garbage you ate is that of your stomach. Plants. There is a car toilet to protect if you want to do it, and in that mall leather toilet.

51
00:03:00,153 --> 00:03:15,126
That was a mystery, isn't it the womb of my mother who protects it? It's like that.

52
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:30,132
Yeah yeah yeah yeah I wonder if it feels like eating garbage. Guinea pigs can eat anything.

53
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:45,131

Garbage collection Protect cans Delicious training There is also a car toilet to protect. The actual guinea pig. So that's it.

56
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:30,108
Don't you remember the guinea pig's toilet? Furukawa is smart. A picture of a mouse.

57
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:45,120
Consideration that everyone is considering snowfall now. I want to see something.

58
00:04:45,120 --> 00:05:00,137
There is a possibility, no, I don't do that. If you cry.

59
00:05:00,137 --> 00:05:30,113
I wonder if there is that CM CM.

60
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:45,124
But the mother who protects with and without humans. You can run.

61
00:05:45,124 --> 00:06:00,141
There is a theory that it does not enter. In rear tie by seeing if it flourishes on Tuesday morning.

62
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:15,119
He says he can see his face. Tuesday morning. Was good. By the way.

63
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:30,104
I didn't have any left. I'm already eating. I wonder if there was something today.

64
00:06:30,104 --> 00:06:45,121
Because I can wake up with the desire to see the orca. I drink a little juice without knowing it.

65
00:06:45,121 --> 00:07:00,173
Don't use this honey black vinegar diet. Mortillas A mother who protects both Kyowa and honesty.

68
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:45,153
The rest is dominated by a good feeling.

69
00:07:45,153 --> 00:08:00,154
The story of my mother who protects me seriously It's only 2 minutes and 40 seconds when it's over because there's only that Morca. I can eat trash Oh, I'm hungry I have a toilet.

70
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:15,087
2 minutes and 40 seconds There is only consideration of sentences. First of all, what is the mother to protect?

71
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:30,146
What is a bruker, what is it for that world, and what is it? Good morning. Good morning Mamoru Kanji.

All of Monaka has blown away, but now it's over.

73
00:08:45,195 --> 00:09:00,133
Then that guinea pig, I've bought that one, maybe that elementary school student. I think it's about 4th grade.

74
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:15,141
I have a guinea pig, not 2 guinea pigs, and that veranda.

75
00:09:15,141 --> 00:09:30,141
I wonder what that happens once in a while. It's like that. A place like that.

76
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:45,109
It's like a udon soon. I've already made it on the first floor window.

77
00:09:45,109 --> 00:10:00,182
Yes, I remodeled it all and made it like a nearby udon noodle for guinea pigs. I had bought it. All women.

78
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:15,149
I think it was a cute name, but I feel like I had a guinea pig once.

79
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:30,145
Listen already. Yo-chan Mari and 6. But I feel like I was a guinea pig.

82
00:11:00,168 --> 00:11:15,050
so.

83
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:30,190
What do you say? The long eggs are quite big, but I cooked some ostrich eggs. I feel like I made a fried egg with a huge egg. was delicious.

84
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:45,156
But I wouldn't touch Mano because it would be dangerous if only a standing man could do it, but that ostrich.

85
00:11:45,156 --> 00:12:00,142
Even if you make a big omelet such as fried egg in cooking training, everyone eats it. I have time after that.

86
00:12:00,142 --> 00:12:15,109
Divide by something. What a frying pan from Jayaken.

87
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:30,151
It's said to make a fried egg. That's right. It depends on the person, but it's fine.

88
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:45,179
The art was a keeper. How to solve the fifth grade of elementary school.

90
00:13:00,153 --> 00:13:15,199

91
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:30,195
San-A Super Chat Thank you. the reptiles are already pretty bad for me. Don't be a snake.

92
00:13:30,195 --> 00:13:45,153
It is impossible to take care of shrimp. Once, even if that snake has escaped.

93
00:13:45,153 --> 00:14:00,156
so. On the contrary, I was a girl for the girls.

94
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:15,124
I want to refuse and stop here and there in the mountains, stop and stop.

95
00:14:15,124 --> 00:14:30,175
I'm thinking about Tomoya, who is in danger of life. I quit after 3 months. The alarm is already late.

96
00:14:30,175 --> 00:14:45,115
I decided to use it. Well, it has become a medicine.

97
00:14:45,115 --> 00:15:00,131
It's about 3 months. Hanasaki Miyabi to save. 3. It's nice all the time.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,124
If that happens, you won't be able to play during the lunch break with everyone.

99
00:00:15,124 --> 00:00:30,132
It was hard, why did you stop? stop. Song. After all, the next one is broadcasting.

100
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:45,089
If so, that would be it. You can play during the lunch break.

101
00:00:45,089 --> 00:01:00,132
There was such a broadcasting department that started 5 hours ago, but that was it.

102
00:01:00,132 --> 00:01:15,153
Tada Woodwork When you eat rice at the broadcasting department's house, that's what you eat in the broadcasting room. That was a little special, wasn't it? My school.

103
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:30,158
You can't eat lunch, right? Yes Yes. At noon, you see, I have to broadcast.

106
00:02:00,113 --> 00:02:15,122
If it's money, it's not like that. There seems to be some people who play Vocaloid songs occasionally.

107
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:30,129
That's true. Nothing, nothing, I don't say anything. How can I get rid of Vocaloid?

108
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:45,145
Maybe it's true these days. I wonder if it will be washed away.

109
00:02:45,145 --> 00:03:00,108
Seriously, but it seems possible if it's junior high school. You may not know that, but when it comes to junior high school.

110
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:15,122
There may be a junior high school, but now that kind of thing is in elementary school.

111
00:03:15,122 --> 00:03:30,214
Chikako Because it's a celebrity or a YouTuber. On the day when I tried to sing Kunogi, it would be extinct.

Oh yeah yeah I was still good at singing so what is sweet singer? It's just black history. That's not good.

116
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:45,146

117
00:04:45,146 --> 00:05:00,216
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah if that's the case already go to school. Please be careful not to broadcast my broadcast.

118

Why don't you tell me when you see it? I'm a family member, so bring it with me.

147
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:30,158
I was wondering why I would do such a terrible thing, and if I hit it, please say something. I'm sorry. I want to do it on PlayStation 5 I want to do it.

148
00:12:30,158 --> 00:12:45,117
Type 4 Torpedo 3 Super Chat Thank you. Well, that's probably a hassle.

149
00:12:45,117 --> 00:13:00,138
Oh yeah, but after all PlayStation 5 if you want to do it. It was huge when I was guided to that room aiming for tea.

150
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:15,150
It's normal to say how long it was. Desktop personal computer. A little more than middle.

151
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:30,129
Middle Middle is a little middle. It was messed up like an air purifier. It starts from the beginning.

152
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:45,206
I bought some games that came with it, and I wonder if it was a robot tomorrow. It's a tiny robot.

153
00:13:45,206 --> 00:14:00,170
It's ok. Then, what surprised me was the vibration of the controller. Movie Village It doesn't just hit and vibrate, it vibrates from various places.

154
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:15,135
Cat. The vibration is like water. There seems to be a type of vibration.

155
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:30,104
The seismic intensity changes depending on the game and the location. Come and come and come and feel like bubbly bubbly.

156
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:45,138
Oh yeah and that trigger, right? Trigger too.

157
00:14:45,138 --> 00:15:00,121
l 2 R 2 There is a trigger, but this time also that trigger. I squeeze my finger when I get the bow.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,117
It's getting harder, isn't it? The trigger for that PlayStation 5 is. Just touching it. It was a lot of fun.

159
00:00:15,117 --> 00:00:30,140
Welcome, take your time. song. It's been raining all the time.

160
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:45,129
It was fun, but it was especially amazing. After all, the vibration of the controller is eternal R 2.

161
00:00:45,129 --> 00:01:00,173
Oh yeah, I think even 2 is Fukutsu when I do FPS like this, but there. I felt like it was going to be, and that's why I wanted to do something like Uncharted.

162
00:01:00,173 --> 00:01:15,134
Ma-chan and the power of PlayStation 5. 16 That's right, I'm FF 10. I want to play on PS 5 I want to play more games.

163
00:01:15,134 --> 00:01:30,130
It's not FF 2 normally. He said it was pretty amazing because he could do it. Otowa's PlayStation.

164
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:45,117
Because it is an SSD inside the box. If the load is different. So a considerable PlayStation 5.

165
00:01:45,117 --> 00:02:00,143
What do you say? I was saying that there aren't many games I want to play, but that's why I think it was a long time.

166
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:15,109
Demon's Souls Remake I heard which one is better because I wanted to do Spider-Man.

167
00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:30,106
Sound Demons. Okuda I'll buy it.

168
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:45,134
I'm thinking of buying one. Because it 's an older brother, because it 's an older brother. But I want to do horns.

169
00:02:45,134 --> 00:03:00,182
Well, it's definitely lemon vinegar. Spider-Man Spider-Man It's like I want to do it. But in the end, I'm a spy in the back, so I'll buy it because I want to do it too.

170
00:03:00,182 --> 00:03:15,145
Oh yeah yeah I also buy Spider-Man because I want to do it when PS 5 hits someday. Sleeve Demon's Soul is only for Co-PlayStation 3.

171
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:30,136
I didn't. My younger brother is amazing, I love that from series, right? Let's get rid of that dark soul, demon's, and bloodborne.

172
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:45,096
I heard he wanted to do it. Spider-Man Because I was Spider-Man.

173
00:03:45,096 --> 00:04:00,162
Oh yeah yeah that's why I'm going to Spider-Man the next day I'm going to the sea And at home. You give the game to my younger brother. It's a game that is being distributed.

174
00:04:00,162 --> 00:04:15,173
Crash Bandicoot and other games that ended with the distribution are quite a gift for my younger brother. I gave it like that and it was true.

175
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:30,094
If you put it in that house. It's a waste not to go to the beauty salon. Why are you here now?

176
00:04:30,094 --> 00:04:45,110
S 5 It will be a loading platform Hanasaki Miyabi's house. I have three brothers. I have my own psps.

177
00:04:45,110 --> 00:05:00,144
That was PS. so. There are 3 and 3 PlayStation 4s.

178
00:05:00,144 --> 00:05:15,163
There is a thunder. Maybe there will be two more in February.

179
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:30,137
Why do you really want me to call you an older brother once in a while? I'll call you my name. Maru-chan Maru-chan Tsutsu. There are many cats with names.

180
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:45,143
It's about my depressive younger brother. It's not Yamato properly, but Yamamoto. But I was the one who took my place.

181
00:05:45,143 --> 00:06:00,170
Hey. I think my sister used to choose 222 points, but now everyone is embarrassed.

182
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:15,094
Hey, that little nice smell. Name Name.

183
00:06:15,094 --> 00:06:30,181
It's terrible It's terrible In the old days it used to be 22224. I don't care about anyone. Both are also.

184
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:45,152
Hide I'm already Yamato-chan, Yamato-chan, Kasatsukasa-chan, and Tsukasa-chan. Brothers Brothers.

185
00:06:45,152 --> 00:07:00,185
When my brother tells me, I feel a little confused.

186
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:15,120
I like it, maybe I'm getting hot with 222. It may be.

187
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:30,163
I'm a little shy during the rebellious period and adolescents. Yes Yes.

188
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:45,111
Anything called at all. Sometimes it's that lately.

189
00:07:45,111 --> 00:08:00,124
When I made that debut, I was cheering for a lot of bubbles. I'm sorry I heard you're watching Heiss.

190
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:15,110
I haven't seen it anymore. Such a woman who is terrible. Until before, it's been a long time.

191
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:30,138
I was watching the online distribution, but now. It seems a little annoying to ask for it, and it's also annoying to write an illustration.

192
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:45,103
I'm the youngest brother. Do you write illustrations?

193
00:08:45,103 --> 00:09:00,143
I'd like you to write a little about the mini characters that will be used next week, but how many. Illustration of Mr. Support Tomita. When I talk about work, I can't put it down a little more.

194
00:09:00,143 --> 00:09:15,186
There is no human rights. Until what time is it today. Next week.

195
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:30,171
Oh, it looks like it's okay. I'll give you a tapestry again. I don't need to say how about that.

196
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:45,131
I'm told I don't need it. I don't need it.

197
00:09:45,131 --> 00:10:00,146
The 1st Anniversary I got the other day Now, the 1st Anniversary is insanely cool. My younger brother. I gave it to someone. I say I don't need it.

198
00:10:00,146 --> 00:10:15,140
It's true that you don't have to enter. I will definitely see it from the beginning. What do you do when your friends come to play?

199
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:30,156
Ah, I know this. It looks bad. It would be awkward if anyone told me what to teach.

200
00:10:30,156 --> 00:10:45,153
But my brother's tapestry. Imagination may be done at home.

201
00:10:45,153 --> 00:11:00,122
Because I'm also a senior of Hololive Production. They also have brothers and sisters, so maybe everyone.

202
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:15,121
Younger brother and sister at Hololive Live Hololive Stars.

203
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:30,184
It's like listening to everyone's stories while being excited secretly like this on the waist. Not even my family.

204
00:11:30,184 --> 00:11:45,107
Oh yeah yeah yeah. My big brother is gone. You could say that.

205
00:11:45,107 --> 00:12:00,166
Oh yeah yeah festival's mother and that older sister. Sometimes chocolate sometimes my younger brother comes out. Make an illustration.

206
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:15,150
I don't know if they will do it, but it seems like we should draw a picture together.

207
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:30,152
I'd like to try something called green beans. It's a story that PS 4 won. My younger brother.

208
00:12:30,152 --> 00:12:45,106
It was a story that I would buy a PS 5 Spider-Man. It was a story.

209
00:12:45,106 --> 00:13:00,127
Who should I talk to? Everyone and my brothers are that. You have to talk to them. You might know if you're told that you're doing it, but I think you're a good friend of mine.

210
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:15,122
Please talk to me properly. It's like this in Tokyo, and it's an hour today. Orecchio.

211
00:13:15,122 --> 00:13:30,120
I'll bring it. Thank you for playing. Please, January is already over. January is over.

212
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:45,097
It's only 11 months. Yes Yes Yes. Why is that so?

213
00:13:45,097 --> 00:14:00,115
LS 3 Soup Chat Thank you Thank you. Spring even in February. Speaking of February.

214
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:15,110
Valentine. Asien's birthday is also February. Tsube.

215
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:30,114
Until February. Like I heard, I didn't hear. I felt like Kageyama.

216
00:14:30,114 --> 00:14:45,054
birthday. 8.

217
00:14:45,054 --> 00:15:00,180
There was, oh yeah, February 25th, everyone. February 25th. It's the 25th of the corner, everyone. There was an incident that night.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,118
In other words, I will be one year old this year. Anything this year? Oh yeah yeah yeah.

219
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:30,174
By the way, how old is Miyabi Hanasaki?

220
00:00:30,174 --> 00:00:45,127
Because it is written. I wonder if it can be pasted somewhere. You can see the setting of my birthday. Okune That's right.

221
00:00:45,127 --> 00:01:00,172
It's my birthday 6900.

222
00:01:00,172 --> 00:01:15,118
So how old is insurance? It's 900 years, so 2. that's strange.

223
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:30,150
2000. Not yet. I'm 120 years old, I haven't come on March 3rd.

224
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:45,143
Even if it's 1900 yen, there are probably quite a few people born in 1900 on Twitter. A little teacher Born in 2900.

225
00:01:45,143 --> 00:02:00,128
Maybe there are some. You can enter number 51 in 1900.

226
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:15,138
Maybe I'm the only one. You see, my friends were of the same generation.

227
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:30,143
Thais are set now. It's the same, it's the same generation. Same year.

228
00:02:30,143 --> 00:02:45,145
It's okay to have each person or one person, not just one person. Even if you're late, it's Christmas, isn't it?

229
00:02:45,145 --> 00:03:00,129
December 24th of Christmas. Also, my dad was born on July 7th. That Tanabata.

230
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:15,176
I'm the second child. I wonder if he was born in Tabata. Third. My mom's birthday is the same. It's the same birthday.

231
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:30,114
Dwell's birthday is when my mom and my brother are on their birthday.

232
00:03:30,114 --> 00:03:45,165
Well, I'm March 3rd, why is that? I'm so happy to be born.

233
00:03:45,165 --> 00:04:00,137
I'm happy. I don't know how it feels to have a child on my birthday because I'm not a mother.

234
00:04:00,137 --> 00:04:15,112
Like special. Well, according to people, this is Christmas, for example.

235
00:04:15,112 --> 00:04:30,121
You're born, you're born on Christmas, so that's it. I heard that it will be a good deal. It's usually cold.

236
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:45,164
It's like Christmas when you're born with rice. It's like Christmas is your birthday. Soft dad had the same birthday.

237
00:04:45,164 --> 00:05:00,119
Why April basics. Puppy Puppy Soft that may be a little cute Maybe the same birthday was good.

238
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:15,153
That's right, it's from kindergarten. Supper properly. Santa is here.

239
00:05:15,153 --> 00:05:30,146
It seems that my dad was Santa Claus. That's why, on that birthday and Christmas, I bought a house for my house.

240
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:45,093
What is a game? I've been playing games since kindergarten. What was the first game I played?

241
00:05:45,093 --> 00:06:00,158
It was all the game I got, that Pokemon. You can overcome Pokemon. I wonder if it's around Diamond Pearl.

242
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:15,122
Wait, is it okay with Diamond Pearl? No, it's different from Waseda. In other words, Black and White Tegu. Is it a song?

243
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:30,111
Wait 10 years ago. Is that enough? Or something like that.

244
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:45,104
I'm not my husband. Sad sad. It's hot.

245
00:06:45,104 --> 00:07:00,145
Pokemon boom elementary school and that's not the case. It was popular when I was in elementary school. It's home, even a little, that gymnastics.

246
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:15,093
I've talked about two episodes. The era of Pokemon is over. It's over.

247
00:07:15,093 --> 00:07:30,167
My voice is trembling and not trembling. Yodel Yodel.

248
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:45,128
That's because it was 5 o'clock.

249
00:07:45,128 --> 00:08:00,145
By the way, let's stop using the needles. I want to say that. Thank you for Super Chat.

250
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:15,112
On the contrary, what do you think everyone is? For generations.

251
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:30,158
I wonder if I can hit the darkness. Ho Ho Ho Gold and Silver Crystal.

252
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:45,113
Gold and silver Pikachu version It's not red-green, isn't it? If there was a bad brother, maybe Leo.

253
00:08:45,113 --> 00:09:00,168
Doggy Red Green Is there snow we were doing together? The snow we were doing together. Even if not.

254
00:09:00,168 --> 00:09:15,244
That's right. It's a butterfly. I don't.

255
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:30,192
Look in my eyes, Dad loves Dad's games. Maybe. Hey demon mom is amazing.

256
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:45,133
Or something like this. Better yet, on the day of release. Because I see it, in the middle.

257
00:09:45,133 --> 00:10:00,179
Maybe that kind of person was made here. In a fairly complicated home. I said I didn't have a grandpa, but my brother.

258
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:15,100
A shocking new fact There was an older brother. Really really.

259
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:30,134
Welcome to school. I'm not an older brother, it's true, it's true. It's a lot older than me.

260
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:45,122
The eldest son is the eldest son. but. There are so many things.

261
00:10:45,122 --> 00:11:00,173
I'm hungry. There was a half-hearted brother. It's okay, this is my big brother.

262
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:15,136
I'm Chan, but to tell the truth, he actually has an older brother. I come back once in a while. I'm coming back.

263
00:11:15,136 --> 00:11:30,130
If you do. Sometimes I'm told that I'm an older brother.

264
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:45,118
What are you like? It's like that.

265
00:11:45,118 --> 00:12:00,169
Because the guy who suddenly calls me an older brother. Then suddenly there are times when he'll be the only one there.

266
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:15,121
There are various things.

267
00:12:15,121 --> 00:12:30,163
Calling by name is certainly what I call by name. It's just like someone else's affair. I'll call you Maru-san.

268
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:45,122
It's not really neat, Marumaru-san says. I'm a brother.

269
00:12:45,122 --> 00:13:00,103
It was so complicated. By the way, I still have a lot of troubles. Actually, I say that I also have an older sister.

270
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:15,154
Actually, it's been 18 years since I was born. but.

271
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:30,175
I have an older sister today, but I met her. I said I was there. Older sister.

272
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:45,129
Just before I graduated from junior high school, my mom came out. Actually, what should I say?

273
00:13:45,129 --> 00:14:00,116
What do you mean by telling a great lie? That is the eldest son.

274
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:15,122
There is, though. It's like a bill. A little from the body.

275
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:30,173
Actually, I thought I was the eldest son. Oh yeah, but I'm the eldest son, but from that point on, my mom.

276
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:45,162
With that kind of kanji. My brother MIYAVI is called a disciple.

277
00:14:45,162 --> 00:15:00,112
As a mother. I'm the eldest son. Hanasaki Miyabi's family.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,131
That's right. It seems that even adults don't come back properly.

279
00:00:15,131 --> 00:00:30,095
Maybe I wasn't hungry. I say.

280
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:45,134
I'm sorry for everyone, on the contrary, really. I told you a little heavy story.

281
00:00:45,134 --> 00:01:00,075
No reaction at all. Ah, I feel like I've already slept. Say it to fruition.

282
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:15,196
I think I'm the eldest son myself, so in this family. But it only comes back once in a while. That's normal.

283
00:01:15,196 --> 00:01:30,115
shut up. Oh yeah yeah yeah. Apart from that, I'm the eldest son in the cat family.

284
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:45,113
I think so. It can't be helped if you worry about it.

285
00:01:45,113 --> 00:02:00,110
That's why I sometimes lie, lie, lie, lie, but I say that's right, but in fact, I also have an older brother. I said that before, but what kind of thing is it? Sometimes I lie.

286
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:15,162
I'll talk deeply only about trees. When I say that Mi-chan is also sleeping. You can be a boy. You can attack.

287
00:02:15,162 --> 00:02:30,149
I'll be happy with you. But there are.

288
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:45,129
I wonder if I can do it. Yes Yes Yes. I wanted a younger sister. Cute cute ex-boyfriend.

289
00:02:45,129 --> 00:03:00,148
It's very difficult. Well, there are various things, after all it was a fight and there was a fight.

290
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:15,135
Hanasaki Miyabino looks like this. Onii-chan Onii-chan is really there. Onii-chan Onii-chan.

291
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:30,161
Hot water It's quite difficult for many years.

292
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:45,117
It was a story that I was doing an Eiken. It's not like talking about it in the morning.

293
00:03:45,117 --> 00:04:00,155
If you live for 120 years, there are many things. You can also do it. No, no, another year.

294
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:15,154
No, I'm 18 years old named 121 years old. I'm always 18 years old. I grew up 18 years old and I'm 18 years old.

295
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:30,131
I'm 18 years old. After all, stop talking about that Pokemon.

296
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:45,182
That's all, so don't do it anymore. It's okay for everyone to think of the age, so Okamochi is launched. Miyabi-kun.

297
00:04:45,182 --> 00:05:00,150
Somehow with myself. I'll give it a try. It's kind of the same generation, isn't it?

298
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:15,159
Next topic. Everyone is 18.

299
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:30,114
I'm glad I'm glad Oh yeah 18 There are quite a few.

300
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:45,152
I'm 18 years old. I can say that I'm still a high school student.

301
00:05:45,152 --> 00:06:00,111
Ikoma Kita High School student. You did it. You can get a motorcycle license. everyone.

302
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:15,183
If you talk, you have to talk. I'm a grave digger, so don't say so. 8. Is it the story of Princess Cafe?

303
00:06:15,183 --> 00:06:30,106

304
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:45,134
There is something out there, but this is a story that there is no information yet. Will be issued. It's a pink shop, everyone.

305
00:06:45,134 --> 00:07:00,127
Hanasaki Miyabino's. It says Prince Cafe Princess Cafe. A princess, not an ace.

306
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:15,093
It's a princess cafe. I think it will come out when I look it up. By the way, when you look at this.

307
00:07:15,093 --> 00:07:30,099
A wife who works with the anime Imada. Yamanosume is a working cell. so.

308
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:45,142
Because there are Holosters in the collaboration event. There are Holosters. But that's it. It only says that it will be held.

309
00:07:45,142 --> 00:08:00,144
It means that there is, even if you do Holosters, nothing has come out yet. Although it says mail order.

310
00:08:00,144 --> 00:08:15,145
And maybe this much. May February. I wonder what it is.

311
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:30,141
Yeah, February, look forward to it. I think there's something fun to do. When I say February, all cats love it.

312
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:45,126
The moon is the moon. Please look forward to it. I'll get drunk.

313
00:08:45,126 --> 00:09:00,121
Hanasaki Miyabi Toki Guidance Talk to Tenma and let him talk. Because there is a possibility of being exposed, we are always checked by the manager.

314
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:15,111
Because there is a possibility of saying good things. The two of us said that we should never say that. I've received a total check.

315
00:09:15,111 --> 00:09:30,104
Maybe everyone will get angry as soon as they are cross-examined for judo.

316
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:45,180
That Tenma-kun's theme What are you doing? Nobita's this isn't it? Absolutely.

317
00:09:45,180 --> 00:10:00,138
Please look forward to it like it's erotic. I wonder if I'm about to be guided.

318
00:10:00,138 --> 00:10:15,128
That's right, so please be careful and don't give me a guided cross-examination. I haven't come.

319
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:30,131
I heard it, but I was muttering, but I wonder if this is Marumaru-san's whole. I wonder if I should say something. Really really.

320
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:45,149
I can't press it. But maybe other people are pretty stubborn, maybe that guy. Chika I'm a loose servant, because I'm two of us, because I'm two of the flower knights.

321
00:10:45,149 --> 00:11:00,123
Say you're pushed. I just want to go on an excursion. I will protect it. Welcome to Anan group.

322
00:11:00,123 --> 00:11:15,165
But I won't say what I shouldn't say. Oh yeah yeah yeah.

323
00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:30,124
I feel like everyone who wants to spoil a little. There was a heavy story for an hour and a half, and a lot of games.

324
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:45,116
After this, Mr. Robe will be delivered from 10 o'clock for Follow Stars.

328
00:12:30,105 --> 00:12:45,142
