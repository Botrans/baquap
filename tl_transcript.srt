1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,944
This situation is not a kind of Mickey, but another condition to connect with Mickey.

2
00:00:19,944 --> 00:00:34,967
I would have said goodbye when I took it down.

3
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:49,969
That's right, please take a photo before it's time to say goodbye.

4
00:00:49,969 --> 00:01:04,897
It's a perfect picture.

5
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:19,929
I can take good pictures. You want it.

6
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:34,919
I'll bring it home. I'm getting closer to you. hear.

7
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:49,919
It is sending Shonan. I've seen the new book for the first time at the country branch.

8
00:01:49,919 --> 00:02:04,937
There seems to be nothing to raise a mole. Because it's getting longer and longer.

9
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:19,932
I'm sick. I want to see the recommendations next time.

10
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:34,984
What is this time What is this time What is this time What? Can it be this long?

11
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:49,965
A woman and a woman. I didn't write behind Inoi, so it was amazing.

12
00:02:49,965 --> 00:03:04,960
I'm sure you'll be surprised to find out where you have friends. Kuri no Okaso.

13
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:34,859
you.

14
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:49,865
What happened.

15
00:03:49,865 --> 00:04:04,932
Not the first of the navel first. That first of the first. I'm not anywhere.

16
00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:19,857
I wonder what happened.

17
00:04:19,857 --> 00:04:34,965
It's bad. Did you go to pick up and eat?

18
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:49,984
Grimm.

19
00:04:49,984 --> 00:05:04,947
I guess I told people.

20
00:05:04,947 --> 00:05:19,913
I've been waiting for you.

21
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:49,941
Yabai Yabai Yabaimon.

22
00:05:49,941 --> 00:06:19,880
Grimm.

23
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:34,930
Today's research presentation bulletin board. Then it was gone.

24
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:49,949
By synthetic voice. It was beautiful. Sakuragaokanishi 9-chome.

25
00:06:49,949 --> 00:07:04,936
Come on for a moment with this blur. I think it will change.

26
00:07:04,936 --> 00:07:19,929
I should have looked around the school festival. It can't be helped even if the level is low.

27
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:34,989
Honestly, Ignihide's BGM is really good.

28
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:49,967
Even though it's a prefectural border, it seems that I will quit the internship year from other people. Research app development.

29
00:07:49,967 --> 00:08:04,018
Expand the email to your monitor or read it aloud.

30
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:19,870
it's alright.

31
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:49,910
In junior high school.

32
00:08:49,910 --> 00:09:04,939
It will be.

33
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:19,966
Attacked by characteristics. Ayane That's what I expected.

34
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:34,936
I think I'll spend another year.

35
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:49,966
I think I'm doing it slowly and slowly. I wonder what will happen.

36
00:09:49,966 --> 00:10:04,962
If that's the case, the beginning shouldn't have been put in. Be careful. I mean, it 's not dangerous.

37
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:19,946
Looks the weakest.

38
00:10:19,946 --> 00:10:34,945
It seems that the intention is the most dangerous. fearless.

39
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:49,935
Ah yes yes yes yes yes yes yes. So that's it.

40
00:10:49,935 --> 00:11:04,954
If you try to put out the candles. Then. Left horse Hey.

41
00:11:04,954 --> 00:11:19,943
I want to read a little. Somehow somehow.

42
00:11:19,943 --> 00:11:34,965
I'm watching it because it has a full voice.

43
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:49,913
Udamon Max Button It's an accident. Congratulations on your outfit.

44
00:11:49,913 --> 00:12:04,963
Because the serious feeling is thorny succulent. Must.

45
00:12:04,963 --> 00:12:19,981
What color are you wearing? Because it is the most noble color among them.

46
00:12:19,981 --> 00:12:34,933
I thought this was a great opportunity.

47
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:49,993
Happy birthday. Unlike you humans, who don't even remember. The runaway tribe.

48
00:12:49,993 --> 00:13:04,960
You can see it at home, because I haven't changed much from this figure until about 100 years.

49
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:19,962
It's no wonder they're happy when they return. I think I can only live for about 100 years. To have a regular stock.

50
00:13:19,962 --> 00:13:34,948
Even so, it's said to be fun. I had never thought about it that way.

51
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:49,950
Insensitive. Because it has a short life. Enjoying humans.

52
00:13:49,950 --> 00:14:19,921
70 people in our country. I heard that he is an excellent magician on campus. Afo guard.

53
00:14:19,921 --> 00:14:34,921
From your point of view. Speaking of.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:14:52,520
I also imitate it.

55
00:14:52,520 --> 00:15:07,525
It may be dangerous.

56
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:22,523
It's quite difficult. The scale to make you happy is too big. Is there anything you are good at? I am confident in playing the instrument.

57
00:15:22,523 --> 00:15:36,482
I was young. Because it wasn't allowed. I was able to practice pre-practice.

58
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:52,522
Among all the stringed instruments you can play, the violin. How about joining the light music club?

59
00:15:52,522 --> 00:16:07,549
I've been invited by Lirio to consider joining the club. Ah, yes, deafening good luck.

60
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:22,505
The diamond also blew bubbles and collapsed.

61
00:16:22,505 --> 00:16:37,534
I don't show my face in the light part. I will not join the club in the future.

62
00:16:37,534 --> 00:16:52,541
where. If you don't save it from your house, you'll immediately try to destroy the earth.

63
00:16:52,541 --> 00:17:07,505
Did you get any contact from your family? The only relative.

64
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:22,503
Originally, he was so busy that he didn't have time to write a letter. Missing every year.

65
00:17:22,503 --> 00:17:36,483
I feel like I'm going down. Always just congratulations on the card. I was planting it in a white garden.

66
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:51,490
Admirable. Of course, the lyrics are like the flowers are in full bloom.

67
00:17:51,490 --> 00:18:07,508
It's my proud garden. What is your favorite food.

68
00:18:07,508 --> 00:18:21,469
At that time, what is Hoobaru? Evaluation.

69
00:18:21,469 --> 00:18:37,508
Is made. It's also interesting to eat. I'm sorry. It's another minute.

70
00:18:37,508 --> 00:18:52,509
After graduating from school. I'm going home.

71
00:18:52,509 --> 00:19:07,551
It's a whole cake. I hate sweets. It's done today at the sea.

72
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:22,537
I can't eat until the end. I don't eat it alone, though I do. Of course I know.

73
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:37,510
I didn't have anything to eat. We all eat at today's party. The impression of RKK may change.

74
00:19:37,510 --> 00:20:07,512
Groovy is really good.

75
00:20:07,512 --> 00:20:22,536
Candy Candy.

76
00:20:22,536 --> 00:20:52,559
I'm enjoying my birthday.

77
00:20:52,559 --> 00:21:07,515
I feel good. What a strange face. It's a very status dungeon.

78
00:21:07,515 --> 00:21:22,509
The number of routes has increased, from the beginning. Ota Dental.

79
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:37,537
I reviewed the video of Sora. Really the first.

80
00:21:37,537 --> 00:21:52,533
It's the first time since Jack's SR hit. Of 22 L.

81
00:21:52,533 --> 00:22:07,520
There are many things to prepare for a birthday. Do you just pull? Because FG weight.

82
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:22,510
Mama It's like tomorrow.

83
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:36,481
Two blades. Show the shape of your soul.

84
00:22:36,481 --> 00:23:06,457
Eel-kun.

85
00:23:06,457 --> 00:23:36,493
Luke's.

86
00:23:36,493 --> 00:23:52,524
I'm here I'm here

87
00:23:52,524 --> 00:24:07,517
Hey Mars Mars-sama, I've put too much into it.

88
00:24:07,517 --> 00:24:22,506
What is Leona? Ah mom up there. I wonder if I can work.

89
00:24:22,506 --> 00:24:37,531
It's a factory again. It will be longer, but please tell me again. Is there a New Year's gacha?

90
00:24:37,531 --> 00:25:06,481
Maybe it will arrive.

91
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:22,502
New my. I'm looking forward to receiving it soon.

92
00:25:22,502 --> 00:25:37,520
I'm thinking of making it cheaper, so when I think about that sentence. Maybe from Hololive Production.

93
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:52,516
I think it's February 8th. I'm on my birthday in February, so I'm looking for gifts. Recruitment.

94
00:25:52,516 --> 00:26:07,526
Because from February 8th. February 4. Well, check the people around that area.

95
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:22,557
Please. Well then, that's all for today. Someone tomorrow.

96
00:26:22,557 --> 00:26:37,539
I wonder what I see. It's a fort, but that Boss Baby's road address. I have one, so I'd love to hear from you.

97
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:52,563
