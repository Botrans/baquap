1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:03:00,166
Silver 10 Battery T 19.

2
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:15,093
What should I give you?

3
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:30,094
I don't have a sniper.

4
00:03:30,094 --> 00:03:45,126
I'm taking it, so what should I do if I want to? Red pink.

5
00:03:45,126 --> 00:04:00,101
Are these guys here?

6
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:15,189
The only black gratin that was struck was Japan. What country do you know about the vassals of the puzzle family?

7
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:30,160
It 's warlike, but maybe it 's there.

8
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:45,089
It's okay to do it three times.

9
00:04:45,089 --> 00:05:00,084
Kijo.

10
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:30,136
But that. It's really crowded I'm dead and I was doing Avex, so it's really bad.

11
00:05:30,136 --> 00:05:45,129
I came again because I had a stomachache and couldn't do it.

12
00:05:45,129 --> 00:06:00,097
It's no different from beer. Maybe it's okay.

13
00:06:00,097 --> 00:06:15,102
Probably because it will be a garden.

14
00:06:15,102 --> 00:06:30,109
It doesn't fall. Because they are in mesh.

15
00:06:30,109 --> 00:06:45,126
Like It's really grateful that it falls a little stronger.

16
00:06:45,126 --> 00:07:00,134
Is it Watt Kakukaku? Meaning like now. It's starting.

17
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:15,041
Is it a little more?

18
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:30,141
Garden 7. I'm going to the garden first, so it's definitely crosstalk here.

19
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:45,171
I did Koshien because I hadn't started anything. You can press it after reloading.

20
00:07:45,171 --> 00:08:00,040
I.

21
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:15,089
Kayo Uno's boyfriend. It's not sunny now.

22
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:30,088
It didn't take a while.

23
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:45,135
I'm doing quite a bit.

24
00:08:45,135 --> 00:09:00,061
I wonder if it has started. Fine.

25
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:15,098
What is the loop that you can beat if you fall in love and press it many times and update it? It's a comment section.

26
00:09:15,098 --> 00:09:30,148
7-chan wasn't doing well. I see.

27
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:45,119
Maybe I'm Discord.

28
00:09:45,119 --> 00:10:00,095
Indefinite employment. I wonder if I lost the war or it's heavy.

29
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:15,139
I wonder if it will be heavy if you put in the land.

30
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:30,126
Even if I don't make an effort, I'm in the middle of the game. I wonder if it can be done. Even later.

31
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:45,097
Who is Kurumi in the special zone? Kurumi-chan?

32
00:10:45,097 --> 00:11:00,093
This is Mana-chan.

33
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:15,140
People still have that, maybe. To the left.

34
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:30,143
I think it's better to have it in the garden. Ryo Yabuuchi now brings someone.

35
00:11:30,143 --> 00:12:00,134
Why is it running out? Tell me a lot.

36
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:15,046
This too.

37
00:12:15,046 --> 00:12:30,056
I'm scared.

38
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:45,137
But this house is absolutely stronger. Tomorrow.

39
00:12:45,137 --> 00:14:15,149
Well then, I should have gone inside.

40
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:45,088
Aizu store I'm going to have lunch. Because the number of people does not decrease.

41
00:14:45,088 --> 00:15:00,138
I'm buying Yoshikawa, so it seems that we have no choice but to enter.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,094
Maybe Yumi wants you to forgive me.

43
00:00:15,094 --> 00:00:45,136
What are you doing now? It's okay because it's in after fixing it.

44
00:00:45,136 --> 00:01:00,045
Your voice is okay.

45
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:45,151
No, the place is too bad here.

46
00:01:45,151 --> 00:02:15,106
Byakuren-sama.

47
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:30,124
That's not cocoa and bread.

48
00:02:30,124 --> 00:02:45,137
Where did you go? Like Duskin.

49
00:02:45,137 --> 00:03:00,107
The legend of cats. It seems that there is a place where I like cats.

50
00:03:00,107 --> 00:03:15,155
Shielded battery. It's Suwa Gas.

51
00:03:15,155 --> 00:04:00,039
But something.

52
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:15,090
But are there still 0 bodies? It's not really.

53
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:30,088
Kick the belly on the first and second floors.

54
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:45,114
Someone is dead now.

55
00:04:45,114 --> 00:06:00,071
No really.

56
00:06:00,071 --> 00:06:45,047
Wow.

57
00:06:45,047 --> 00:07:30,102
What's so strong? Why are you so strong? The last you guys are so strong, stupid.

58
00:07:30,102 --> 00:07:45,096
I'm sorry for being a little bad.

59
00:07:45,096 --> 00:08:00,101
I want to learn what happens. I don't want to get used to it anymore.

60
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:15,131
I'm not used to it I'm not used to it at all. It was returned.

61
00:08:15,131 --> 00:08:30,126
Will it change if I go home?

62
00:08:30,126 --> 00:09:00,079
It's okay.

63
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:15,123
That's okay, right? Keep showing this screen.

64
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:30,041
OK.

65
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:45,197
Delivery of a love song that was written as "Puttsun Man Blame".

66
00:09:45,197 --> 00:10:15,118
Sneezing Nose stuffy nose does not heal. What was piled up.

67
00:10:15,118 --> 00:10:30,055
what will you do.

68
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:45,134
Even if you mute it in Hanshin, you can hear it here.

69
00:10:45,134 --> 00:11:15,102
Heals stuffy nose. I wonder why. Ah.

70
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:30,106
If it's dangerous.

71
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:45,120
Anything fits, but it's impossible. Anything is fine.

72
00:11:45,120 --> 00:12:00,101
I hope you can see it.

73
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:30,132
Yesterday yesterday or the day before yesterday may have been nervous.

74
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:45,125
I haven't done it yet. It's boring.

75
00:12:45,125 --> 00:13:00,098
I can't see the result. Because I got it.

76
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:15,118
It dries quickly. It was 16th place.

77
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:30,135
Rabbit lock. It was 6000 yen 6.50, but 5 days.

78
00:13:30,135 --> 00:13:45,145
This will probably start too.

79
00:13:45,145 --> 00:14:00,109
Everyone is there and something doesn't start. Be careful.

80
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:15,116
Please for a change. It's free for more than 3 minutes.

81
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:30,129
No, it would be bad if it started with this. So that's it.

82
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:45,123
If this can go to Oarai, I'll go. It's not cold.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,122
I have a runny nose.

84
00:00:15,122 --> 00:00:30,074
I have a runny nose.

85
00:00:30,074 --> 00:00:45,106
5th by 55 minutes.

86
00:00:45,106 --> 00:01:00,046
Welcome back.

87
00:01:00,046 --> 00:01:15,260
It was too dangerous, wasn't it? Then everyone is there. I wonder if my home is a BGM sink.

88
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:30,156
While it's right.

89
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:45,154
I wonder if it is. Even if you play BGM at such times, you can hear it after 3 minutes.

90
00:01:45,154 --> 00:02:00,120
Now let it flow. But. Sekaimon after 3 minutes. It's amazing.

91
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:15,098
It's kind of messy, isn't it?

92
00:02:15,098 --> 00:02:30,197
Before, Ryukakusan's throat candy is bad, so beans are dangerous. Sano in a blue bag.

93
00:02:30,197 --> 00:03:00,128
That's right, Kobe. It's too late to notice.

94
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:30,110
But because I work, I really eat. I don't put anything in it.

95
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:45,100
It's good because it's sweet.

96
00:03:45,100 --> 00:04:00,124
Why do you talk about this?

97
00:04:00,124 --> 00:04:15,128
One minute left. That's right. let's do our best.

98
00:04:15,128 --> 00:05:00,156
It's super happy to play BGM. Doshin-chan Usa Panda.

99
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:15,129
I can't remember I can't come. But come on.

100
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:45,134
please do not worry. Probably not in the house.

101
00:05:45,134 --> 00:06:00,121
Then I can't enter now.

102
00:06:00,121 --> 00:06:15,142
Lucifer. I'm here today.

103
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:30,127
I'll go like this the day after tomorrow. It's the best-selling Japan.

104
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:45,069
2020.

105
00:06:45,069 --> 00:07:00,096
On your behalf.

106
00:07:00,096 --> 00:07:15,081
R 3 O 1. Discovered a German shotgun.

107
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:30,119
There is no rain.

108
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:45,122
Petit Pois. Yes you can.

109
00:07:45,122 --> 00:08:15,130
The people of Solare are awesome.

110
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:45,117
It would be nice if there was NH from the garden from here. Return.

111
00:08:45,117 --> 00:09:00,109
Others are coming down from here.

112
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:15,095
Cuckold that can be used for 1 minute.

113
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:30,129
I opened the door. It doesn't rain so much with disposable chopsticks.

114
00:09:30,129 --> 00:10:00,117
The shield cell is. Maybe I want an extension of the light.

115
00:10:00,117 --> 00:10:15,054
3. Maybe I should move now.

116
00:10:15,054 --> 00:10:30,106
Scary tv.

117
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:45,054
Helmet.

118
00:10:45,054 --> 00:11:45,039
Where.

119
00:11:45,039 --> 00:12:00,103
I'll make that girl. That's OK.

120
00:12:00,103 --> 00:12:15,095
It's Matsuki's anti. Almond flowers. Does it depend on it?

121
00:12:15,095 --> 00:12:30,182
How about Cozy Corner Cake Would you like to go from here?

122
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:45,156
I think there is definitely an orare. Who is moving to the Bonsai Plaza, so why not buy it here? That was it.

123
00:12:45,156 --> 00:13:15,118
Ah. Are you out already?

124
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:30,130
This guy can't charge.

125
00:13:30,130 --> 00:14:30,146
Nicole KARA.

126
00:14:30,146 --> 00:14:45,119
It's not possible to have a portal for some kind of hometown.

127
00:14:45,119 --> 00:15:00,086
I may not be able to come out. Then there is no choice but to detour.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,091
Please this and that here and there. I'm not so happy with recovery.

129
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:45,151
Maybe there is one of the people I mentioned earlier. If you do hear it, bring it when it's over. Fine. Words so far.

130
00:00:45,151 --> 00:01:00,122
You were surrounded.

131
00:01:00,122 --> 00:01:15,154
It's dangerous.

132
00:01:15,154 --> 00:01:30,102
Maybe I can go back again. I'll use it as a foot. Okay okay okay

133
00:01:30,102 --> 00:01:45,123
I thought maybe it was behind me.

134
00:01:45,123 --> 00:02:00,117
But it's gone.

135
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:15,116
I'm waiting for the lights, I'm not waiting for a while.

136
00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:30,089
Ah, I left this.

137
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:45,149
But everyone should write it first.

138
00:02:45,149 --> 00:03:00,123
Transform.

139
00:03:00,123 --> 00:03:30,146
O'Neill.

140
00:03:30,146 --> 00:03:45,119
I don't know if Ueno is Fubuki-chan. May come.

141
00:03:45,119 --> 00:04:30,099
The order of likes.

142
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:45,130
It's okay That post said that the fight was strong.

143
00:04:45,130 --> 00:05:15,131
adjust. Good at home.

144
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:45,107
Oxidized daytime first. MEGARYU.

145
00:05:45,107 --> 00:06:00,137
On a slope.

146
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:15,170
There is a village.

147
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:30,113
It's like that.

148
00:06:30,113 --> 00:07:30,078
I will place an order.

149
00:07:30,078 --> 00:07:45,154
I think I'll look for it next time. Please stop.

150
00:07:45,154 --> 00:08:30,082
Was it devastated?

151
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:45,122
I was able to do that. I like Prowler.

152
00:08:45,122 --> 00:09:00,061
Verification.

153
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:15,089
For him, Mr. Nakamura's place.

154
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:30,111
Presbyopia lens.

155
00:09:30,111 --> 00:10:00,121
Pachislot fortune-telling is different. It's not very dangerous.

156
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:45,099
What will happen now?

157
00:10:45,099 --> 00:11:00,041
Raccoon.

158
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:15,106
Ah, that's okay.

159
00:11:15,106 --> 00:12:00,128
I think I'll do something if I throw something.

160
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:15,130
It's not Kabuki.

161
00:12:15,130 --> 00:13:15,139
I wish the dog didn't come, maybe.

162
00:13:15,139 --> 00:14:00,044
It wouldn't hurt if the Gas team won two straight games.

163
00:14:00,044 --> 00:14:30,140
No, the last battle everyone. It's spicy.

164
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:45,124
It's thin.

165
00:14:45,124 --> 00:15:00,118
It will change.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:45,189
North new guy.

167
00:00:45,189 --> 00:01:30,140
Mr. Matsuki.

168
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:45,084
Aim for a fast child. feed. I think I'm sleeping nicely.

169
00:01:45,084 --> 00:02:00,083
Not night shift. What don't you say?

170
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:30,045
Remain until the end.

171
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:45,123
I'm serious. It.

172
00:02:45,123 --> 00:03:00,133
Really strong.

173
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:15,114
It's 1 kg from 79th to 14th.

174
00:03:15,114 --> 00:03:30,080
I opened it up in 11 earlier.

175
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:45,118
Did you get it?

176
00:03:45,118 --> 00:04:00,107
It's high 2 that you don't want to disappear.

177
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:15,155
I think I'm aiming for the middle with me. It can also be a gas shield.

178
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:45,125
Don't say it now.

179
00:04:45,125 --> 00:05:00,097
I don't need myself.

180
00:05:00,097 --> 00:05:15,118
There are many teams that are not in the team. I do not think so. It may be three people.

181
00:05:15,118 --> 00:05:30,145
It seems that it is also a Pikmin and Kasah tournament.

182
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:45,114
I'm aiming for 16th place.

183
00:05:45,114 --> 00:06:00,042
I put it in.

184
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:15,131
Because I said it earlier. Marie's return is also her wife.

185
00:06:15,131 --> 00:06:30,119
You can go.

186
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:45,129
It's like deciding to clean. NATURUM. My own.

187
00:06:45,129 --> 00:07:15,114
A miracle is happening seriously. Just yourself.

188
00:07:15,114 --> 00:07:30,066
What should I do?

189
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:45,160
No, why? I like autumn sushi and I like Ayame-chan.

190
00:07:45,160 --> 00:08:00,116
By the way, it's nothing to play with, I'm serious.

191
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:15,126
I wonder what to do. Accelerate.

192
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:45,132
That's right, I don't use a practice diary.

193
00:08:45,132 --> 00:09:15,088
I used it casually. Now 07th.

194
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:30,109
Somehow. No, I think 10 is fine.

195
00:09:30,109 --> 00:09:45,110
I'm strong because I'm doing it. It's really light blue. I didn't say that, so seriously.

196
00:09:45,110 --> 00:10:00,130
Why are you worried?

197
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:15,045
This champion.

198
00:10:15,045 --> 00:10:30,174
In time than you. The screen is pulling.

199
00:10:30,174 --> 00:10:45,105
I think I'm aiming for 16th place.

200
00:10:45,105 --> 00:11:15,131
But maybe you want to see it, go down to that world garden. No, not me.

201
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:30,126
Marui is also rusty, but it's down under the honey.

202
00:11:30,126 --> 00:12:00,127
Get a short distance. Compared to the craft this time.

203
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:15,117
I wonder if there is a little. Menacing Cabinet.

204
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:45,158
I'm looking at the bamboo shoots with the handle now. please stop. For medium distance.

205
00:12:45,158 --> 00:13:15,159
There are only ten batteries 08. JR Farah Battery for those who have separated. String oil.

206
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:45,158
If you do a light song. I want to move.

207
00:13:45,158 --> 00:14:15,076
I am. What is a sniper?

208
00:14:15,076 --> 00:14:30,144
Sentinel was about to get off.

209
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:45,153
Yumi Taiyo moves to the same city. There's something here.

210
00:14:45,153 --> 00:15:00,135
I'm scared to be embraced.

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,094
It came out 1. Yes, I can't say it anymore, there is only a lift.

212
00:00:15,094 --> 00:01:00,077
OK OK I'll craft it.

213
00:01:00,077 --> 00:01:30,139
Everyone's pachislot.

214
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:45,128
Maybe you want a piece of jelly pulp.

215
00:01:45,128 --> 00:02:00,130
Sky here Tomorrow towards the black tower People coming up from the right may win.

216
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:15,151
It may have been lost. Someone who knows why I made so many batteries.

217
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:30,094
Bad boys will come to the city.

218
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:45,101
I might have hit it.

219
00:02:45,101 --> 00:03:00,116
Do you have one team? Is it a gift?

220
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:15,134
Wampa was flowing but it wasn't dead. I want to go to the middle.

221
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:30,100
It looks like it will be good. Then I'm not waiting for that time.

222
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:45,126
I'm scared, but look around. We are here. I'm running.

223
00:03:45,126 --> 00:04:00,093
Anchovy suddenly.

224
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:15,123
That's right.

225
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:30,133
Hotta I fell down. That's why I'm going, so get off one. It's okay above, too.

226
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:45,103
This is Ultra. turn right.

227
00:04:45,103 --> 00:05:15,118
I'm sorry, I thought it was here.

228
00:05:15,118 --> 00:05:30,100
Looking from above.

229
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:45,107
Ma-chans.

230
00:05:45,107 --> 00:06:00,115
I won't lose a lot anymore. OK.

231
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:15,099
There is also a little right. Furusatokan. Maybe that's okay.

232
00:06:15,099 --> 00:07:15,041
It's dangerous.

233
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:45,157
The replicator goes into orbit.

234
00:07:45,157 --> 00:08:00,124
This is okay. All you need is water.

235
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:15,052
be careful.

236
00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:45,138
I'll eat it. Portal Knights.

237
00:08:45,138 --> 00:09:15,124
I think it was $ 16.

238
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:30,145
01.

239
00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:45,095
I was so happy that I drank during Christ.

240
00:09:45,095 --> 00:10:00,129
Curacao.

241
00:10:00,129 --> 00:11:15,102
Thermite grenade. Shotgun drum.

242
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:30,075
This one and the anti are quite good.

243
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:45,091
Release the forest house.

244
00:11:45,091 --> 00:12:15,044
scared.

245
00:12:15,044 --> 00:12:45,110
The song was swayed nicely.

246
00:12:45,110 --> 00:13:30,073
If you wind it outside.

247
00:13:30,073 --> 00:14:00,081
Killing magic. Hey.

248
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:15,125
You're good at singing.

249
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:45,103
Yanai After that, I'll go down.

250
00:14:45,103 --> 00:15:00,123
Those who believe will be saved. 17th.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,175
It's not a thyme store. Of pink mask 3.

252
00:00:30,175 --> 00:02:00,117
Shall we go.

253
00:02:00,117 --> 00:03:15,152
Arale hasn't come out.

254
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:30,039
amazing.

255
00:03:30,039 --> 00:04:00,121
You can see it as it is.

256
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:15,111
General hall information.

257
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:30,131
Tosa There will be twice.

258
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:45,163
You'll be in 16th place. I can't help it because I don't know what the rice will be like at home. Honestly.

259
00:04:45,163 --> 00:05:00,107
If there are no 16 side by side.

260
00:05:00,107 --> 00:05:15,133
I wonder if they will come to both teams when it's over.

261
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:30,137
Uncle Corone 16 Does that mean it doesn't exist?

262
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:45,150
It's dry at the rock-paper-scissors place. It's not the number of screws If you go there anymore. Never be together.

263
00:05:45,150 --> 00:06:00,118
People who want a PC too much.

264
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:30,127
The ranking of where you can see it.

265
00:06:30,127 --> 00:07:30,105
Is there an announcement of the overall ranking?

266
00:07:30,105 --> 00:08:45,126
I'm taking a break now. Spiritual unity.

267
00:08:45,126 --> 00:09:00,105
No, that's really true. I haven't eaten. Just now.

268
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:15,120
Do not wash your house as it takes time to watch.

269
00:09:15,120 --> 00:10:00,043
It's over. It's over.

270
00:10:00,043 --> 00:11:00,097
Miki Maya.

271
00:11:00,097 --> 00:11:15,103
I already have it. Concentration.

272
00:11:15,103 --> 00:11:30,134
It starts in 6 minutes and has 2 minutes left. Because.

273
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:45,097
I wonder what it is.

274
00:11:45,097 --> 00:12:00,067
Not yet.

275
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:30,050
I was talking with mute.

276
00:12:30,050 --> 00:13:00,125
I'm sorry. I'll be back home. Because it's late.

277
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:15,060
That's right, it's from 6 minutes already. No. Patience patience. what is it.

278
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:30,111
That's not it. Is not here. Bab-chan.

279
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:45,080
Mom, not mom. Not 7.

280
00:13:45,080 --> 00:14:00,047
It's not rain. Mom. Noisy noisy.

281
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:15,125
Not 7. Yes I ate chocolate.

282
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:30,110
let's go. Baby peace of mind I'm sorry YouTube.

283
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:45,047
I wonder if there is a PC inside.

284
00:14:45,047 --> 00:15:00,128
Now match Now match. How much should I aim for the game from now on?

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,042
I'm happy that.

286
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:30,092
You may be happy with your PC.

287
00:00:30,092 --> 00:00:45,122
I will go from here first.

288
00:00:45,122 --> 00:01:00,149
Fukusaki lie. That's not true.

289
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:30,124
48 scooter.

290
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:45,039
seriously.

291
00:01:45,039 --> 00:02:00,140
I sent it.

292
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:15,099
Japan Energy. Sniper's yeah.

293
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:30,124
It's a long way from fighting. How do you go?

294
00:02:30,124 --> 00:02:45,137
I did it yesterday I did it yesterday. From here on the Kobe lift bar.

295
00:02:45,137 --> 00:03:00,134
You said, why don't you go from yesterday? I've already fallen asleep on bamboo shoots.

296
00:03:00,134 --> 00:03:15,134
Haya time phone.

297
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:30,151
Let's do it seriously. It's still Round One.

298
00:03:30,151 --> 00:04:00,122
It sticks when it becomes a bond center. Keep in the middle. Ayumi wants to come to Chanmomo.

299
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:15,135
That that shape.

300
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:45,113
Look around.

301
00:04:45,113 --> 00:05:00,144
It looks okay from the orbit.

302
00:05:00,144 --> 00:05:15,087
It's vacant, isn't it? You'll come in first. Even if you see it, you can go up from the right.

303
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:30,087
What should I do?

304
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:45,126
I saw it about twice. After all from around here.

305
00:05:45,126 --> 00:06:00,113
I'm in the foreground.

306
00:06:00,113 --> 00:06:15,137
Maybe it's okay if it doesn't come.

307
00:06:15,137 --> 00:06:30,157
Fine. Seriously high.

308
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:45,085
Lucelle.

309
00:06:45,085 --> 00:07:00,070
I want to get out quickly. middle.

310
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:30,090
That's fine. Song song song.

311
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:45,096
Fight night. Let's punch the aroma.

312
00:07:45,096 --> 00:08:00,130
A new attempt. It's not open.

313
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:15,086
Mama put in various things.

314
00:08:15,086 --> 00:08:45,095
Todaimon clock.

315
00:08:45,095 --> 00:09:00,080
I haven't seen the previous house.

316
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:15,134
Cute I don't want to fight here.

317
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:45,119
I may not be able to come. I'll be at the front desk.

318
00:09:45,119 --> 00:10:00,137
Where is the young child? A strong place.

319
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:15,140
Fukuoka Starbucks is scary. Also, I'm really scared of people from above. For the time being, I can't pass the vehicle inspection.

320
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:30,115
Terms and conditions.

321
00:10:30,115 --> 00:10:45,121
From Tonight to Ogikubo. Saitama.

322
00:10:45,121 --> 00:11:00,107
You should take it.

323
00:11:00,107 --> 00:11:15,112
It may not be a mess from here.

324
00:11:15,112 --> 00:11:30,141
That woman, isn't it?

325
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:45,124
Ah, that's right. This is when I'm fighting like that.

326
00:11:45,124 --> 00:12:00,163
You may be angry.

327
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:15,143
I'm glad I came early.

328
00:12:15,143 --> 00:12:30,122
I was doing it. Pond 9007.

329
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:45,096
There is no sound in the upper left, though.

330
00:12:45,096 --> 00:13:00,130
Who is Watanabe's girlfriend?

331
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:15,111
Are you daddy? What are you looking at?

332
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:30,133
Saitama isn't there.

333
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:45,125
I don't know if it will come, but there are some. Maybe it broke down over there.

334
00:13:45,125 --> 00:14:00,109
You can have a look there.

335
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:30,118
Maybe this is Paka-chan. This is bad.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,127
Where are you with your baby?

337
00:00:30,127 --> 00:01:00,088
No, it's hard to wear this.

338
00:01:00,088 --> 00:01:15,096
It was welfare, I have to remember.

339
00:01:15,096 --> 00:01:30,082
One person is different. Use your computer.

340
00:01:30,082 --> 00:02:00,047
Here it is.

341
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:45,041
Different.

342
00:02:45,041 --> 00:03:15,109
How many times?

343
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:30,086
Yoshi-chan, where are you looking at?

344
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:45,121

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:30,091
You've entered 2 kg. In front of me.

347
00:04:30,091 --> 00:05:30,046
Judgment is quick.

00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:45,048
gas.

349
00:05:45,048 --> 00:06:30,140
It's a team.

350
00:06:30,140 --> 00:08:15,093
Oh la la la la. After all it is squishy. I hope you sell the yen.

351
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:30,117
It's a very high ranking. Used peach sale.

352
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:45,124
It's clear.

353
00:08:45,124 --> 00:09:00,108
Mr. Q. Even at home. Unseed Machida City Yamane.

354
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:15,169
You should go. I wonder what it is now.

355
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:30,044
16th place.

356
00:09:30,044 --> 00:10:15,125

I'm worried that it's outside now. Fast menstrual timer.

359
00:10:45,106 --> 00:11:00,137
It's a flower that doesn't wither. Is it enka?

360
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:15,100
Anyone can get some sweets.

361
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:30,121
I like a home PC. I like meteorites.

362
00:11:30,121 --> 00:12:00,131
Where are you looking at breaking news? Where is it? Where is it? I have too much money.

363
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:15,094

00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:30,138
Where do you see the rice? summer.

365
00:12:30,138 --> 00:13:15,118
There was a person in the comment section after it was over. What are you doing?

366
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:30,175
Other teams may come up seriously at the end.

367
00:13:30,175 --> 00:14:15,151
Why everyone.

368
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:30,103
this is.

369
00:14:30,103 --> 00:15:00,126
You may not get it. No, you can get it already.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,126
Kita final battle. Star.

371
00:00:15,126 --> 00:00:30,133
Than I thought at all.

372
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:45,090
3 more people.

373
00:00:45,090 --> 00:01:00,131
I wonder where the team dropped. Where was it? Moreover, it was Shirahama.

374
00:01:00,131 --> 00:02:00,119
I'm in 15th place right now.

375
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:15,133
I will tell you later. 2 points 32 points Ueda City.

376
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:30,134

377
00:02:30,134 --> 00:03:00,127
No buoy. There is nothing. There is something.

378
00:03:00,127 --> 00:03:15,125
Net part.

379
00:03:15,125 --> 00:04:00,156
It's not me so much, it's a problem child. Animation at the time of kanji.

380
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:15,126
Aim to be within 10th place. That's right.

381
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:30,128
I'm really strong with my grandma. It's the last.

382
00:04:30,128 --> 00:04:45,132
Yoshi.

383
00:04:45,132 --> 00:05:00,132
I'm going to yakiniku at noon. Let's do our best at the end Let's do our best.

384
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:30,134
I should have returned. Victory awaits ahead.

385
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:45,049
I really want it.

386
00:05:45,049 --> 00:06:00,137
I want to see this screen.

387
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:15,141
The first time I knew I wanted a book that the fish tower would wear. 1 Charlie.

388
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:30,130
It's a lie construction. Second Maiko.

389
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:45,125
I wonder if it's on the left. Hello Kitty.

390
00:06:45,125 --> 00:07:15,093

Are you wearing a cat? Pastel B1F. I'm running but it's true.

393
00:07:45,127 --> 00:08:00,110
Where are the spinning cats?

394
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:15,128
Soba-kiri I was dancing with a smell.

395
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:30,121
It was stolen, but there is a slightly delicate place. Such a photo Jumping into the sky.

396
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:45,125
Kirby Ever is an anti-Mio solar array.

397
00:08:45,125 --> 00:09:00,140
I'm scared.

398
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:45,101
08 Anima black.

399
00:09:45,101 --> 00:10:00,076
A dog who doesn't do it here.

400
00:10:00,076 --> 00:10:15,137
Solar array Nodoka Nursing Forest may be in front of it.

401
00:10:15,137 --> 00:10:30,080
I have a shotgun.

402
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:45,128
Gray won't come so if anyone can have one. It's free, though.

403
00:10:45,128 --> 00:11:15,165
Ayame-chan has no head.

404
00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:30,125
I found a helmet again Level 1. You can sleep and get fat while you are an adult.

405
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:45,130
Arcana. I haven't seen 48 or 6 times. This is also pretty good because it's in the middle.

406
00:11:45,130 --> 00:12:00,197
I wonder if it will come from afar. Keep it away.

407
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:15,037
Mom.

408
00:12:15,037 --> 00:12:45,144
This is that.

409
00:12:45,144 --> 00:13:00,151
It's not today, it's a little far.

410
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:15,095
Dog.

411
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:30,185
When I was there. Mahjong may go there.

412
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:45,087
Take it widely. If you come from it, you will be hit.

413
00:13:45,087 --> 00:14:00,143
Takechi.

414
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:15,117
Hit the head.

415
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:30,129
Be careful because it was targeted. Crafting is bad.

416
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:45,117
Maybe it's true. Yeah.

417
00:14:45,117 --> 00:15:00,131
I'm only in Iruma, but I'm going to channel 7 Now Fruits Thank you both.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,080
I don't want to wake up.

419
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:30,128
You can't use it for different people. I'm here. According to this because I'm licking my legs.

420
00:00:30,128 --> 00:01:00,046
Should I move too?

421
00:01:00,046 --> 00:01:15,056
you're right.

422
00:01:15,056 --> 00:01:30,159
Book photo You can see it from a cat that you can't see after you show it.

423
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:45,109
I'm dropping it. I'm sorry I went up the stairs. I think it will come.

424
00:01:45,109 --> 00:02:00,163
The ice pillow has arrived.

425
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:15,137
It's about to end Now 8 Part 8 Part 5 may come.

426
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:30,058
Werner this.

427
00:02:30,058 --> 00:02:45,127
It was included a while ago. You're often there.

428
00:02:45,127 --> 00:03:00,167
You're angry. I cut 6 o'clock and it's purple.

429
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:15,149
I wonder what happened. Yoshitaka.

430
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:30,128
Shoot it down. Painful illness.

431
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:45,105
I think I can connect up to this point.

432
00:03:45,105 --> 00:04:00,108
It's something near children.

433
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:15,072
I want to cancel. Yamaga.

434
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:30,136
Put it in once.

435
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:45,125
This man is terrible.

436
00:04:45,125 --> 00:05:00,114
Yokomachi Oh yeah, I wonder if I can cancel it now or put something in it.

437
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:15,079
You can get above this because you can enter.

438
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:45,079
That thing.

439
00:05:45,079 --> 00:06:00,102
Katsuki is here.

440
00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:15,084
Lotte is too strong over there.

441
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:30,141
I put it in, but it's a little tight towel because it's struck.

442
00:06:30,141 --> 00:07:00,105
3 batteries. I also quit.

443
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:15,099
It looks okay.

444
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:30,112
Because it's a big Mac. But. It's 30 seconds.

445
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:45,049
have mistaken.

446
00:07:45,049 --> 00:08:00,106
Level 2.

447
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:15,129
It's still quite a while.

448
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:30,115
I want to stick it on my brother as well.

449
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:45,119
Black soybeans I'm wrong, so I'm not you anymore. There is a mysterious hole.

450
00:08:45,119 --> 00:09:00,146
Month 2 It's already here. This is also good.

451
00:09:00,146 --> 00:09:30,127
I'm back. It may not be a miracle.

452
00:09:30,127 --> 00:10:00,109
If possible, it's over. smoking.

453
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:15,088

Rurubu PC.

456
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:30,157
What are you doing?

457
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:45,107
I saw it, but what happens here?

458
00:11:45,107 --> 00:12:00,102
Yakiniku at home.

459
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:30,160
I can cook.

460
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:45,129
Like that noisy.

461
00:12:45,129 --> 00:13:15,047
This is too bad.

462
00:13:15,047 --> 00:14:30,122
Maybe there is a store in it. I'm glad.

463
00:14:30,122 --> 00:14:45,115
That's right, but PC may not be possible.

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,099
This is impossible.

465
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:30,040
this is.

466
00:00:30,040 --> 00:01:15,117
Brother Is that an overstatement? Wasn't it 5th?

467
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:45,035
It's over.

468
00:01:45,035 --> 00:02:00,080
It was really fast.

469
00:02:00,080 --> 00:03:00,113
There is a dog that is not a bath chair.

470
00:03:00,113 --> 00:04:00,106
Ah, that's right. After it's over, everyone.

471
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:15,076
Dick normally. custom.

472
00:04:15,076 --> 00:05:00,113
Nothing has come yet. No progress. The customer has been disbanded.

473
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:15,047
I'm curious about the result.

474
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:30,127
Something went wrong 16. Next delivery. I'm going to interview him.

475
00:05:30,127 --> 00:06:45,042

476
00:06:45,042 --> 00:07:00,086
If you ask 10.

477

I'm listening to the BGM pack because I'm too free. Piano.

478
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:45,134
It may disappear. I don't know yet.

479
00:08:45,134 --> 00:09:00,062
I'm not aiming for 16th place. nuts.

480
00:09:00,062 --> 00:09:45,139
The warrior logo now.

481
00:09:45,139 --> 00:10:15,060
You're kind.

482
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:30,055
14th place.

483
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:45,051
There is such a thing. There is such a thing.

484
00:10:45,051 --> 00:11:30,111
It's the one I'll do here.
