1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:10:30,142
Ahhhhh.

2
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:45,120
I'll bring that, so wait a minute, something like this.

3
00:10:45,120 --> 00:11:00,100
I feel like I haven't come. At this moment, I'll bring my stuff.

4
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:15,107
My mother is okay, why don't you?

5
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:30,099
Even after a long time, I didn't do Saturdays and Sundays by manufacturer.

6
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:45,114
It's amazing to be able to come this day, right? I'll drink Red Bull from the morning.

7
00:11:45,114 --> 00:12:00,108
Erotic videos Hero Hero. I'm not all.

8
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:15,091
Red Bull hasn't arrived yet. Resume Red Bra I haven't received it yet.

9
00:12:15,091 --> 00:12:30,131
It hurts even though it's hard to reach. Someone could get Red Bull, but he also got a PC.

10
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:45,138
It was. It's much lower, but it's still a lot strange.

11
00:12:45,138 --> 00:13:00,132
I'm still there. I don't really understand the structure. What do you do with PC delivery?

12
00:13:00,132 --> 00:13:15,160
What do you do with PPC delivery?

13
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:30,121
What do you mean. It's not a PC than a game distribution.

14
00:13:30,121 --> 00:13:45,132
Somehow I understood.

15
00:13:45,132 --> 00:14:00,104
The game is spirit 8.

16
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:15,156
I'm stupid. I'm using a trap in the usual delivery environment, so I'm wearing a cap cap.

17
00:14:15,156 --> 00:14:30,109
You're using an external capbo. If it was Yuko Kurobe-chan.

18
00:14:30,109 --> 00:14:45,116
Such a capbo.

19
00:14:45,116 --> 00:15:00,168
Is it an image that the PlayStation 4 you are doing now will be another computer? Switch and PlayStation 4. Is it here? Kariya city.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,148
At this time, it would be nice if it was delivered to a PC. It's going to be a lot easier, because it's less of a burden, so it's simply alleviated.

21
00:00:30,148 --> 00:00:45,117
It's fine to convert. It was because it would be, but now it seems that I can afford it at all. But if possible, even if I don't like it, the electricity bill is more.

22
00:00:45,117 --> 00:01:00,146
Thank you for your interest, Miki Neko.

23
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:15,172
Certainly, it would be nice to be able to deliver in various forms. Thank you for the gut tension summer heat.

24
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:30,123
I don't want to keep going around, but I wonder if I'll do it with distribution.

25
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:45,084
Thank you very much. I don't think it's boring.

26
00:01:45,084 --> 00:02:00,104
I think. Play behind the scenes.

27
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:15,162
I wish I went down.

28
00:02:15,162 --> 00:02:30,130
No, I want to do it when I go. Takao was a good boy. Nagao-kun was a good boy.

29
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:45,156
HY Thank you very much for the summer heat. Thank you very much.

30
00:02:45,156 --> 00:03:00,118
It's raining, so if we get along with each other so much, I wonder if our team would be. I wonder what it was like.

31
00:03:00,118 --> 00:03:15,153
Thank you Ueno Car Black and White Tokunaga Thank you very much for coming from Mr. Nagao.

32
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:30,145
If there is, it is quite usual.

33
00:03:30,145 --> 00:03:45,134
Ah, that's right. Thank you very much.

34
00:03:45,134 --> 00:04:00,157
I wish they both had fun. Nagao-kun's delivery I've seen it several times. It's a round face. Nagao-kun.

35
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:15,115
Why cremation. Even though they are mutual followers, for some reason they really are. Watch Fumi's delivery once in a while.

36
00:04:15,115 --> 00:04:30,103
Why? I used to see it in the flow.

37
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:45,098
At the end of 10 o'clock, I wondered what I was doing and delivered it. Kumi-san was strange. I want to go out.

38
00:04:45,098 --> 00:05:00,174
I have seen it. Nagao-kun is amazing because I knew that kind of thing.

39
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:15,139
Look at it.

40
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:30,047
Really.

41
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:45,149
Actually it was.

42
00:05:45,149 --> 00:06:00,111
I really went to the mountains, nice to meet you. Something was hot.

43
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:15,126
Say nothing Avex. Both the doctor and me.

44
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:30,109
This guy was born amazing. Editing erotic videos. It seems to be doing.

45
00:06:30,109 --> 00:06:45,094
What I thought about the soil was that the tournament was so funny.

46
00:06:45,094 --> 00:07:00,108
At the last race, when the point of view really came into tatters. Losing to the team of Mr. Matsui and Mr. Kato. Become 10 and kidnap it.

47
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:15,134
Easy victory That was interesting. it was fun. I am also grateful to Mr. Ishihara.

48
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:45,117
This week is just this kind of thing to tell you.

49
00:07:45,117 --> 00:08:00,110
Because I have a job. It's fun, so don't worry, there are things you can enjoy. Please rest assured.

50
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:15,101
Collaboration. There may be quite a few.

51
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:30,129
There are quite a few. Thank you for the BBC jazz, be careful and morning is always early in the growing season.

52
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:45,083
Weather forecast Kochi. Yo-Kai Watch. There will be collaboration next week.

53
00:08:45,083 --> 00:09:00,104
There will be the next week. A lot of movies Adaya.

54
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:15,110
Kotoura It's being delivered, but I'm over sleepy now. You're on the other side of the sleeper. I'm sorry I might take a nap.

55
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:30,141
It's 3 o'clock when it's over.

56
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:45,100
It will be delivered from 8 o'clock today from 8 o'clock. I thought I'd do it tomorrow.

57
00:09:45,100 --> 00:10:00,116
He's big. I said it correctly, but he's sick.

58
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:15,104
I'm sick, but really.

59
00:10:15,104 --> 00:10:30,099
That is a serious illness. That is.

60
00:10:30,099 --> 00:11:00,144
When was the Tenman Hall?

61
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:45,125
It's a big rave.

62
00:11:45,125 --> 00:12:15,144
I played outside the pole. If the motive is crazy, there are only really good people.

63
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:30,137
Good morning with just your feet Good morning. Robert this evening. I'm not sleepy yet.

64
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:45,191
I want to distribute the app. You're not putting yourself on the shelf, because I'm the most decent.

65
00:12:45,191 --> 00:13:15,192
Why can I say that to people?

66
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:30,145
brother 0 After a long time.

67
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:45,088
There are many things I want to do.

68
00:13:45,088 --> 00:14:00,134
I'm looking forward to it. The fact that one more money is over means that something will start again.

69
00:14:00,134 --> 00:14:15,157
Disassemble.

70
00:14:15,157 --> 00:14:30,171
Art It was really fun, it was really fun. 120,000 Chinese soda Thank you very much. It looks like I went to 120,000.

71
00:14:30,171 --> 00:14:45,194
I will do my best again. Somehow I am.

72
00:14:45,194 --> 00:15:00,156
Also, I got a check mark, I got married. Nankai evening Robert. Maezawa official.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,070
It's on.

74
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:30,144
Thank you very much. If it was unofficial until now.

75
00:00:30,144 --> 00:00:45,141
Zipper because it was an unofficial existence. It seems that it has become a rigid type. Thank you.

76
00:00:45,141 --> 00:01:00,120
It's a nice story even if you don't have a moderator.

77
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:15,165
I think it's amazing.

78
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:30,157
But it's the real thing to get the story. YouTube Some people don't know why they are called sons.

79
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:45,122
I was called because I was going abroad.

80
00:01:45,122 --> 00:02:00,135
My son. The official release is actual. Then that's the meaning.

81
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:15,180
I wish. That's right.

82
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:30,112
After all, do you need such a black label starter set?

83
00:02:30,112 --> 00:02:45,189
Yeah, thank you so much. Some people came from good friends. I'm glad there will be.

84
00:02:45,189 --> 00:03:00,135
You'll know in 3 minutes. You don't know me in 3 minutes.

85
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:15,124
You can see Robert in the evening in 3 minutes.

86
00:03:15,124 --> 00:03:30,162
I want to hear that kind of thing. I'm really worried.

87
00:03:30,162 --> 00:03:45,121
Please tell me if you were told. Become a habit.

88
00:03:45,121 --> 00:04:00,138
The one called Robert in the evening is open 60.

89
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:15,088
I'm so hot I'm worried about this. Burns.

90
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:30,135
Look, that's the countdown. It 's not good. Thank you to Zenmai-san member Turkish machine.

91
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:45,143
I look forward to working with you in the future. I'm thinking of doing something like that. Thank you very much, but Mr. Wang sometimes thank you at the supermarket. Use That's not the case, maybe.

92
00:04:45,143 --> 00:05:15,110
The door shift is like a fucking big countdown this time.

93
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:30,108
It was on the 1st floor, but it's buggy again. There seems to be Yuu. 2 delivery archive chat disappeared.

94
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:45,099
I see, when I look at my red, only gold is flowing in the comment section. What do you mean?

95
00:05:45,099 --> 00:06:00,133
There is also such a thing. Delivery of breasts.

96
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:15,109
The gacha has disappeared, but it's pretty hard. I want you to fix it. I want it.

97
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:30,136
Because if you think so, it's Google.

98
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:45,166
Not outside. The server went down. There was one time, Google's server.

99
00:06:45,166 --> 00:07:00,112
That's right.

100
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:30,151
I can't send emails People who use au Gmail can't send emails. We wouldn't mind if this disappeared.

101
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:45,155
Tenma oysters I can't sleep. When I went for one generation and ate ramen.

102
00:07:45,155 --> 00:08:00,125
That's why there are so many things, I can't say anything about it.

103
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:15,109
I thought it was strange, but everyone was like that. If you haven't done so, everyone should do it yesterday.

104
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:30,135
Really, this is also true. It has withered.

105
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:45,118
But I can't do it anymore. It's not a vtuber anymore.

106
00:08:45,118 --> 00:09:00,117
It's called Tuber.

107
00:09:00,117 --> 00:09:15,111
It was ruined with the premiere release.

108
00:09:15,111 --> 00:09:30,151
Thank you when the rain comes back Mom member Turkey Thank you big Thank you big Thank you big. Like a bitch. As I said before, I think it's possible to create an account.

109
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:45,140
By the way. it can. Thank you very much for watching.

110
00:09:45,140 --> 00:10:00,119
To the dragonfly.

111
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:30,127
Being stabbed by okara.

112
00:10:30,127 --> 00:11:00,146
At that timing, I was really good at 15th place. I'm happy normally.

113
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:15,120
You can usually get a nice computer.

114
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:30,116
Will my environment be ready again?

115
00:11:30,116 --> 00:11:45,135
In the first place, it's a burn. I don't know because I've only seen Gravo for a while.

116
00:11:45,135 --> 00:12:00,159
What is it? There may be until that is the main.

117
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:15,138
Uramoto Is it better to open the game?

118
00:12:15,138 --> 00:12:30,105
Didn't you say you want to change the medical association? I want to buy something. I have it.

119
00:12:30,105 --> 00:12:45,113
That crazy. Not because.

120
00:12:45,113 --> 00:13:00,117
3070 or 2000.

121
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:15,140
May become.

122
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:30,169
2070 instead of 70. Not necessarily. I'm planning to move on Saturday morning, but I'd like to move now.

123
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:45,154
Elsa Super Thank you for a little big Thank you for a big big. Thank you as always. 1080 or something.

124
00:13:45,154 --> 00:14:00,100
Isn't it good at all? While delivering.

125
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:15,129
To put it the other way around, he endured the highest quality until he got there. You know.

126
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:30,122
I think 2060 is okay too. Let's play today.

127
00:14:30,122 --> 00:14:45,132
I think it's a 3070 drama sub. Thank you very much.

128
00:14:45,132 --> 00:15:00,122
Even my sisters, everyone who took me down. Of everyone else. Everyone is good, but I'm 2070 super.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,147
It's correct, but it seems to be the most expensive.

130
00:00:15,147 --> 00:00:30,255
Microphone. From Aikura. Still certainly.

131
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:45,149
Wasn't it 7th or 9th next year?

132
00:00:45,149 --> 00:01:00,124
Finally. There is some compatibility around here.

133
00:01:00,124 --> 00:01:15,134
Tenma's PC specs seem to be high.

134
00:01:15,134 --> 00:01:30,136
It's the one that comes out with 240 FPS per sheet. Yeah, isn't it surprising?

135
00:01:30,136 --> 00:01:45,098
Maybe I don't have the image of playing a game. One piece of bread is 204.

136
00:01:45,098 --> 00:02:00,142
200.

137
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:15,139
240hz. Better yet, buy a good one. I thought I'd make it App 20.

138
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:30,123
Around the sound.

139
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:45,066
say it.

140
00:02:45,066 --> 00:03:00,088
I bought a good one. After all, the ones that are expensive are basic.

141
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:15,167
If you can afford it, don't buy it. That's right. Insanely Solomon.

142
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:30,136
It's like losing money to buy cheap goods.

143
00:03:30,136 --> 00:04:00,114
Distributor Do you want to spend money on the distribution environment?

144
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:15,115
The example is. I want to keep it as much as I can. Seafood has a high possibility of gacha, so wiring is the best.

145
00:04:15,115 --> 00:04:30,122
New issue Starting today, we can deliver a personal computer, a personal computer, and a monitor.

146
00:04:30,122 --> 00:04:45,108
Delivered over the phone line Baba. What can I do? It's amazing.

147
00:04:45,108 --> 00:05:00,126
Euler.

148
00:05:00,126 --> 00:05:15,111
It's not when the Eiken 100 isn't exceeded. I think it's only when it doesn't exceed 100.

149
00:05:15,111 --> 00:05:30,116
I don't know if it's up or down.

150
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:45,105
At the very least, there are places where you want money. Download 360 upload 380.

151
00:05:45,105 --> 00:06:00,093
I think I bought a house for the wiring gacha.

152
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:15,159
I'm really worried about moving.

153
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:30,144
There is also a time zone, after all. I want to get hurt.

154
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:45,102
Like 280.

155
00:06:45,102 --> 00:07:00,152
I bought a lot of neuros and listened to them. The match is really worth it.

156
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:15,153
Living at home may be difficult, but seafood is certainly on your own.

157
00:07:15,153 --> 00:07:30,124
Thank you anymore.

158
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:45,096
Change providers.

159
00:07:45,096 --> 00:08:00,101
Wouldn't it be a pain at least when it comes to the act of browsing the internet? Words seem to fly.

160
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:15,126
Good morning Good morning Thank you very much Good morning.

161
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:30,046
Extremely.

162
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:45,137
Why are all those harsh words to me? Why can everyone say harsh words to me so easily?

163
00:08:45,137 --> 00:09:00,112
Really. I can say my feelings toward the person in front of me.

164
00:09:00,112 --> 00:09:15,123
I'm sad, brother. sad. Buster is awesome Who will experience it.

165
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:30,114
I told you.

166
00:09:30,114 --> 00:09:45,135
Good morning I saw yesterday 8 Good morning with comments Thank you very much for starting it in the evening Robert. Thank you.

167
00:09:45,135 --> 00:10:00,115
Arrow Kanahei applied Teke Teke live play. Get out, play live.

168
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:15,088
It's amazing. I'll try it next time.

169
00:10:15,088 --> 00:10:30,078
By the way, in collaboration.

170
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:45,126
I'm in here right now. Indian night.

171
00:10:45,126 --> 00:11:00,113
The rest is ok.

172
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:15,127
It's a live collaboration. Live collaboration.

173
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:30,100
Thank you for your cooperation. Live collaboration.

174
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:45,127
Yes, this one is all you need. That Ichinohe construction shop. The continuation of the wheel excavator. I feel like doing it.

175
00:11:45,127 --> 00:12:00,096
Come into the table.

176
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:15,133
The outside is decided. I would be happy if you could do me at the construction shop.

177
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:30,154
I'm ordering. I'm grateful to the guy who came in for what kind of place.

178
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:45,130
Because I was a friend. But there are also Saturdays.

179
00:12:45,130 --> 00:13:00,151
There is also Saturday. But from that point on, I'll be coming in here and there next week.

180
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:15,141
I'm looking forward to it. It's Tatsuya in February, isn't it? There aren't many in March.

181
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:30,136
This is it. Thank you. Nice to meet you, Yuko black belt character.

182
00:13:30,136 --> 00:13:45,130
I don't think it's nice to meet you. start. happy. I don't think it's nice to meet you.

183
00:13:45,130 --> 00:14:15,153
Gorilla-san.

184
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:30,108
Babies R Us Super Chat Thank you for your money Thank you very much. With Gorilla. Color Palsant.

185
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:45,116
I wonder if I ate it for the first time with Egg. Nice to meet you.

186
00:14:45,116 --> 00:15:00,140
I had to do something on Twitter. That there.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,106
I would like to compare it with the anime Yuko.

188
00:00:15,106 --> 00:00:45,093
Well, the people around me too. Make friends with Mr. Haneru, who has a lot of sea. I am indebted to you.

189
00:00:45,093 --> 00:01:00,099
If you say that, I like my bike.

190
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:15,116
Nice to meet you in various ways. this. Nice to meet you.

191
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:45,128
It was dark and super interesting. Also, if you have a chance to play, please do not miss it.

192
00:01:45,128 --> 00:02:00,124
Gan-chan's. There was, though.

193
00:02:00,124 --> 00:02:15,105
What do you think? If you get involved once in the morning, it's not once. Salmon is salty.

194
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:30,116
Admin also. Moe Tomita.

195
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:45,152
After being insanely kind, Min-san too.

196
00:02:45,152 --> 00:03:00,190
It's messed up because I enjoyed it no matter what, 6 too. Mako who had various exchanges. What do you want to do because the nights have increased? That's right.

197
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:15,160
I want to talk. That's good.

198
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:30,152
I really appreciate it. All the movies because salt is important.

199
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:45,152
You're a little maker because I closed the late night festival delivery. I want you to stay, but after it's over, something like admin. So that.

200
00:03:45,152 --> 00:04:00,152
Four people are talking to say hello. Mito Famous Confectionery Red at your place.

201
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:15,132
When I went down and looked at the log, Robert did it.

202
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:30,150
If I do it, I'll go.

203
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:45,188
trainer. No, it's really a burn on the shelf.

204
00:04:45,188 --> 00:05:15,157
I wonder if I should give it a try, or maybe I should use two PCs or FPS Kamimaki. Thank you for the demon.

205
00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:30,125
Such a wonderful painting. I don't know. How was it after all? That mode.

206
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:45,137
Thomas 55. Mama mama mama.

207
00:05:45,137 --> 00:06:00,097
I was interviewed for nothing.

208
00:06:00,097 --> 00:06:15,143
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to enter. It 's good, it 's good.

209
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:30,141
I didn't expect to receive Shinichi Niwa.

210
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:45,170
Even if you play that, it's definitely a matter of counting up after it's over. The people who run it and the dolls did their best.

211
00:06:45,170 --> 00:07:00,142
It's best not to have it, but I don't envy this.

212
00:07:00,142 --> 00:07:15,148
That really makes the results sometimes obscured by bugs. The result has changed.

213
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:30,149
It can't be helped over there. It's so much fun. Ibara-san, thank you very much.

214
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:45,119
I sat down insanely. The kanji for movement. Do you have a novel collaboration?

215
00:07:45,119 --> 00:08:00,131
I really want to recommend it because there is a party. Roberto Kosena Iru Roberto Roberto is out.

216
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:15,119
I wonder if it's possible, but there was such a song.

217
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:30,142
I don't know what the order is, but please order it.

218
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:45,165
If you think about it the other way around, it's not a good idea to order a rabbit rabbit.

219
00:08:45,165 --> 00:09:00,096
Then weird.

220
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:15,133
Wrong and not wrong. Romero smashed snack bell.

221
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:30,083
I can fly I can fly. Please treat it politely.

222
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:45,135
It's crowded because it's apexel riding a cicada. Go back to casual. Apex that becomes a racemic by flying a drone.

223
00:09:45,135 --> 00:10:00,110
Look into the sky.

224
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:15,163
Morning I don't really like cicadas I really hate them. I hate how much I hate it so much that I hit my little finger on the chest of drawers.

225
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:45,135
It's unforgivable love. I really want you to stop I want you to stop.

226
00:10:45,135 --> 00:11:00,115
I threw a cicada tomorrow.

227
00:11:00,115 --> 00:11:15,117
I'm not angry anymore. It is an enthusiastic performance.

228
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:45,137
Really free.

229
00:11:45,137 --> 00:12:00,143
Maybe my husband has a cicada, that's because the number of viewers isn't going down.

230
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:15,127
I have to cherish it, so the story will certainly change. Somewhere somewhere.

231
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:45,098
I don't care, but it depends on what I'm eating. It's a big punishment game.

232
00:12:45,098 --> 00:13:15,106
Somehow that already.

233
00:13:15,106 --> 00:13:30,122
If it's really impossible, if you really don't like it, it's really attached. I can't stop it. It's really impossible. It's really impossible.

234
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:45,123
I don't want to show this.

235
00:13:45,123 --> 00:14:00,050
Impossible.

236
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:30,156
Insects are generally machines, so it's a sloppy forest. Atsushi Forest Bug I'm pretty tight. I'll do it.

237
00:14:30,156 --> 00:14:45,118
That that is already that. Why that person can hold Yamama Yuga with one hand.

238
00:14:45,118 --> 00:15:00,145
Antos is the Tanda battle billing method.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,134
When it's morning. and doing I'm sorry.

240
00:00:15,134 --> 00:00:30,122
But Winning VS Yonagunisan.

241
00:00:30,122 --> 00:00:45,105
There is no chance of winning. I have a chance to win.

242
00:00:45,105 --> 00:01:00,147
That's why I had a beetle, so I don't touch it as I grow up.

243
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:15,039
Mountain.

244
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:30,124
Isn't it strange?

245
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:45,121
I have a connection with this kind of person. It's done. Winning vs Yonagunisan vs 10.

246
00:01:45,121 --> 00:02:00,129
Isn't it spicy? Don't take 3 even if it's small 3.

247
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:15,113
I think I can rap.

248
00:02:15,113 --> 00:02:30,125
There is no Osho, so a coaster for such a game.

249
00:02:30,125 --> 00:03:00,144
It's work, morning activity. Where the time has ticked.

250
00:03:00,144 --> 00:03:15,137
Maybe I'm taking a nap for lunch. You all have that kind of heart at work. From 8 o'clock at night.

251
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:30,160
Yeah, I think I'll deliver it on that night, so by all means.

252
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:45,115
Those who sent it on purpose Thank you very much Thank you always Thank you Thank you very much. I hope you can do various things. See you on today's broadcast Thank you for your hard work.

253
00:03:45,115 --> 00:04:00,128
Yeah, it 's smooth.
