1
00:00:00,000 --> 01:07:20,383
What are you doing today?

2
01:07:20,383 --> 01:07:34,488
I didn't decide.

3
01:07:34,488 --> 01:07:49,456
I'm going to do Splatoon 2 together this time.

4
01:07:49,456 --> 01:08:04,496
There are three rules for Pam's and Oke Bath to fight.

5
01:08:04,496 --> 01:08:19,483
I'm thinking that I might have a little battle with it. Quibo battle.

6
01:08:19,483 --> 01:08:34,497
It's a secondary weapon. It was quite difficult to fight with only quick bombs. Try this. Well, that's done with territory.

7
01:08:34,497 --> 01:08:49,471
Do you have a quilt you put in? And.

8
01:08:49,471 --> 01:09:04,476
Kakurenbo is everyone.

9
01:09:04,476 --> 01:09:20,534
Which is faster, all Kakurenbo are hiding. I'm thinking of doing it right away.

10
01:09:20,534 --> 01:09:34,467
What are you teaching?

11
01:09:34,467 --> 01:09:49,465
I was ridiculed.

12
01:09:49,465 --> 01:10:19,460
There is no particular result. I'll leave Oyabin to Corone-kun.

13
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:34,488
You cut off the sound today. I understand.

14
01:10:34,488 --> 01:10:49,453
How long have you started?

15
01:10:49,453 --> 01:11:05,506
I played. I think you are a beginner.

16
01:11:05,506 --> 01:11:19,457
Rank 25 Why? It's a place called Sea Minus.

17
01:11:19,457 --> 01:11:35,516
That plabe pass is now pasting porridge, so there.

18
01:11:35,516 --> 01:11:50,517
I did it even at night, but I did it for a while. Calculated from Keiko incandescent data.

19
01:11:50,517 --> 01:12:04,491
Did you do it to the last minute? A little mom.

20
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:19,484
I wonder if mom was a dad.

21
01:12:19,484 --> 01:12:35,503
I wonder if it will take a while to come in.

22
01:12:35,503 --> 01:13:20,501
Well, you can give it that way.

23
01:13:20,501 --> 01:13:34,461
It's really dangerous.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 01:13:51,437
SEIKIN.

25
01:13:51,437 --> 01:14:06,452
I flew.

26
01:14:06,452 --> 01:14:51,434
If you look at a recent drama, please do this. Yes Yes. I'm not spit on that.

27
01:14:51,434 --> 01:15:06,370
Please.

28
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:21,408
It's no good.

29
01:15:21,408 --> 01:15:51,433
This is also the original original that the head family says.

30
01:15:51,433 --> 01:16:06,469
Let's have 9 swings. Up to girls 32.

31
01:16:06,469 --> 01:16:36,485
Make the sauce from the volume, which is a little bit dangerous.

32
01:16:36,485 --> 01:16:51,388
Apparition.

33
01:16:51,388 --> 01:17:06,471
Rice field left over call Wait a minute. Because the memo breaks up.

34
01:17:06,471 --> 01:17:21,448
Ayame is a little now. There are three big snowstorms. What should I do? Zodiac.

35
01:17:21,448 --> 01:17:36,488
Even if you decide on one person to take a rest in that tub bath Ogawa. Something like everyone from the hotel.

36
01:17:36,488 --> 01:17:51,476
I thought it was okay and found out. That's coming and ringing. think.

37
01:17:51,476 --> 01:18:06,391
Yes Yes Yes Yes.

38
01:18:06,391 --> 01:18:21,479
Let's go with this Then let's break up 2.

39
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:36,490
Attribute to be born Oyama Splatoon only.

40
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:51,442
I wonder if my son is more amazing on the map.

41
01:18:51,442 --> 01:19:06,413
Because it's over.

42
01:19:06,413 --> 01:19:21,462
I'm sorry I can go, but it's not good.

43
01:19:21,462 --> 01:19:37,506
sorry. With a secondary weapon. Fill it all.

44
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:51,432
It's important to me.

45
01:19:51,432 --> 01:20:06,482
Like Kimura here. Beard Daddy.

46
01:20:06,482 --> 01:20:36,475
That's right, who is the one who goes apart and paints beautifully?

47
01:20:36,475 --> 01:21:06,431
Everyone has strong dads and moms. I want you to do your best to support me.

48
01:21:06,431 --> 01:21:36,444
You can hide this. Nikko from Kanda.

49
01:21:36,444 --> 01:22:06,456
It may be strange.

50
01:22:06,456 --> 01:22:36,441
Basically, wait a moment for distant places.

51
01:22:36,441 --> 01:22:51,436
I'm not really there.

52
01:22:51,436 --> 01:23:06,443
Where is where

53
01:23:06,443 --> 01:23:21,464
Where is Mikamine?

54
01:23:21,464 --> 01:23:36,457
That's right because I can't go to see it.

55
01:23:36,457 --> 01:24:06,486
I thought I wasn't prejudiced, but it was here. I put it here. You could climb here.

56
01:24:06,486 --> 01:24:21,418
This was cold, wasn't it? No, we are.

57
01:24:21,418 --> 01:24:36,427
I'm pretty bad.

58
01:24:36,427 --> 01:24:51,468
The next stage is different.

59
01:24:51,468 --> 01:25:06,472
However, a good place to hide. Probably but from the start. After all. I think I'll start in the near future.

60
01:25:06,472 --> 01:25:21,473
If you put it all together, it feels awful when you get in here from the beginning.

61
01:25:21,473 --> 01:25:36,434
OK OK. Near the respawn point. I was wondering if I could climb, but I could climb.

62
01:25:36,434 --> 01:25:51,479
It's like shit, but don't say it.

63
01:25:51,479 --> 01:26:06,419
It's okay to say that it's gone.

64
01:26:06,419 --> 01:26:21,416
It seems to be done in the studio. What the hell is that?

65
01:26:21,416 --> 01:26:36,457
I won't come, so I'll stop.

66
01:26:36,457 --> 01:26:51,464
Next is four people and four people. Cafe from here.

67
01:26:51,464 --> 01:27:06,456
I think you understand. I will ask you to do it for the first time.

68
01:27:06,456 --> 01:27:21,413
This is like this.

69
01:27:21,413 --> 01:27:36,431
Please hide and wait.

70
01:27:36,431 --> 01:27:51,454
I love you. Even baseball Subaru is a girl.

71
01:27:51,454 --> 01:28:06,420
Soba noodles for girls. It looks different.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 01:29:08,473
Wait while doing a mysterious dance while baking.

73
01:29:08,473 --> 01:29:23,477
Even a mysterious dance.

74
01:29:23,477 --> 01:30:08,476
It's a branch office so let's all go out for a drink. yeah, I'm doing it.

75
01:30:08,476 --> 01:30:38,480
Lala Lala Lala Lala.

76
01:30:38,480 --> 01:31:38,489
1 minute 53 seconds.

77
01:31:38,489 --> 01:31:53,483
The result exceeds this. I want to do it.

78
01:31:53,483 --> 01:32:08,475
I'm sorry.

79
01:32:08,475 --> 01:32:38,491
1 minute 53 seconds of medicine Overturn the coating power. We bring more. start.

80
01:32:38,491 --> 01:32:54,503
Yes, it's sour. Yes, I have to find it quickly.

81
01:32:54,503 --> 01:33:09,531
Is it cute even in a super shape?

82
01:33:09,531 --> 01:33:23,473
But this too. Because there isn't.

83
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:39,515
I knew that I had no choice but to walk.

84
01:33:39,515 --> 01:33:53,477
I can go if I sleep well.

85
01:33:53,477 --> 01:34:38,454
please tell me. I'm sorry I made a mistake.

86
01:34:38,454 --> 01:35:08,483
What is this a little? When will you come back? I will.

87
01:35:08,483 --> 01:35:23,480
Mom mom mom. I may have told you to fix it.

88
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:39,523
Because I'm learning an instrument.

89
01:35:39,523 --> 01:35:53,478
That's because it's de ***. You can go from Urayasu.

90
01:35:53,478 --> 01:36:08,472
What should I do to organize something else? OK. Because it will be today.

91
01:36:08,472 --> 01:36:39,519
I'm crushing it a little. Isn't it a cutlass fish?

92
01:36:39,519 --> 01:37:09,542
If I win here, I think there is a true victory. Don't fall it maybe.

93
01:37:09,542 --> 01:37:39,534
I wonder if it's okay.

94
01:37:39,534 --> 01:37:53,444
Chris Hart.

95
01:37:53,444 --> 01:38:09,503
Congratulations.

96
01:38:09,503 --> 01:38:38,464
54.

97
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:54,513
I'm here, so please look forward to it.

98
01:38:54,513 --> 01:39:09,520
I think it's better to go.

99
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:38,497
I think that is that.

100
01:39:38,497 --> 01:40:23,491
Come out inside.

101
01:40:23,491 --> 01:40:54,515
I accidentally fell from myself.

102
01:40:54,515 --> 01:41:39,521
Can you win with this?

103
01:41:39,521 --> 01:41:53,461
We will start from 24:00 from the final race area.

104
01:41:53,461 --> 01:42:09,570
Time because I don't have a school sister. Let's do it next. Let's get together on the way home.

105
01:42:09,570 --> 01:42:23,466
My dad has become stronger. That's the last minute.

106
01:42:23,466 --> 01:42:39,501
Can I go now? Up to this point, it's about playing, isn't it?

107
01:42:39,501 --> 01:43:09,522
There is nothing in particular.

108
01:43:09,522 --> 01:43:23,498
It's a head-to-head game. Wakaba shooter.

109
01:43:23,498 --> 01:43:38,488
It's strong, but the method is quite different. Do you want to start breaking up?

110
00:00:00,000 --> 01:43:56,436
I came in.

111
01:43:56,436 --> 01:44:11,432
From now on, even if you really understand.

112
01:44:11,432 --> 01:44:26,412
I have taken measures against cornet.

113
01:44:26,412 --> 01:45:11,422
It's funny. Somehow forever.

114
01:45:11,422 --> 01:45:41,456
Even for girls, that wasn't the case with Splatoon.

115
01:45:41,456 --> 01:45:56,431
Then no one would have done it all.

116
01:45:56,431 --> 01:46:11,447
There are days like that.

117
01:46:11,447 --> 01:46:26,423
6 hour timer.

118
01:46:26,423 --> 01:46:41,472
This is because I'm adjusting the motivation over there. That's what it means to make it bumpy.

119
01:46:41,472 --> 01:47:11,437
That's true. It's like a version.

120
01:47:11,437 --> 01:47:26,435
It might be a bucket, so here.

121
01:47:26,435 --> 01:47:41,367
You must be kidding.

122
01:47:41,367 --> 01:47:56,426
I was sleeping until a while ago. You can play around with Asia.

123
01:47:56,426 --> 01:48:11,458
It may be that the line is not compatible with someone. It's Subaru for the first time, so I'll hang a room with 8 sheets.

124
01:48:11,458 --> 01:48:26,474
It's amazing right now, but I'm setting up a new room, so I'll come in there. Stage selection.

125
01:48:26,474 --> 01:48:41,458
Thank you Thank you What?

126
01:48:41,458 --> 01:48:56,453
Now we have to divide the team.

127
01:48:56,453 --> 01:49:11,475
Bravo Bravo Bravo Bravo Bravo. Thank you. Thank you so much.

128
01:49:11,475 --> 01:49:27,523
I'm pretty nervous to have a match, isn't it? But I've never hit it.

129
01:49:27,523 --> 01:49:41,455
The difference between when hamsters got together. I haven't done it the most.

130
01:49:41,455 --> 01:49:56,405
If you don't like an umbrella sniper.

131
01:49:56,405 --> 01:50:11,440
Laura Japan Tobacco.

132
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:41,415
Communication status.

133
01:50:41,415 --> 01:53:26,418
I'm at the beginning. I don't know.

134
01:53:26,418 --> 01:53:41,416
I'll call you back, but I'll come in.

135
01:53:41,416 --> 01:53:56,461
If it doesn't work, ask Corone to remove it with a single cry.

136
01:53:56,461 --> 01:54:11,422
I apologize for the apology.

137
01:54:11,422 --> 01:54:42,500
The house was probably not good because of something wrong with it, and something went wrong. In the hide-and-seek just before. It was because I wrote Aogaki and made a playful sound.

138
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:56,493
I'm sorry Yes. I said it again.

139
01:54:56,493 --> 01:55:11,426
If you have time to use it. let's do it. Excuse me, please look for it.

140
01:55:11,426 --> 01:55:26,446
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your support.

141
01:55:26,446 --> 01:55:56,442
The place where the woman fell The very first place is Rabbit Gamers.

142
01:55:56,442 --> 01:56:11,456
It's rather difficult here.

143
01:56:11,456 --> 01:56:26,437
Don't fall.

144
01:56:26,437 --> 01:56:41,462
Tell me if you apologized to that mother later this time.

145
01:56:41,462 --> 01:56:56,419
In battle because it doesn't go out.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 02:00:15,560
I'm old too.

147
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:44,476
Will you be back in the lobby at home or will you be back on Saturday?

148
02:00:44,476 --> 02:01:14,483
Not yet, a little bit, I want to revenge this. I bought it, but I feel like I lost a little.

149
02:01:14,483 --> 02:01:45,509
It's so early that Pablo's swing speed isn't it. I'm sorry.

150
02:01:45,509 --> 02:02:00,514
Button-chan and resentment-chan, I think it was the first day of the day. Next time, by all means, that quivo battle.

151
02:02:00,514 --> 02:02:29,474
At the end. Did I quit saying before?

152
02:02:29,474 --> 02:02:45,513
With Holmes.
