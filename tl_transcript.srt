YouTube isn't strange, so it's not strange. Because it's lacking Ah yes yes yes yes yes. Where next.

7
00:01:45,158 --> 00:02:00,152
When I bought it, I think it's powerful and immortal. After that, stop the center twice. I'm nervous.

10
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:45,121
You're really coming to watch the game. I'm being targeted by Japanese spirits and octane. Because there is, quite a while ago.

11
00:02:45,121 --> 00:03:00,130
I wonder how much this was aimed at in both cases.

00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:15,088
Next to this. Budget and big bamboo grass. Next next, we are.

13

00:05:45,145 --> 00:06:00,057
Really.

24
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:45,109
There was no Tokatsu-gun. Wasn't there a voice?

25
00:06:45,109 --> 00:07:00,133
I went to the cram school that came closer for a moment. It's crushed.

00:07:45,111 --> 00:08:00,144
You can be radical. Who bra.

30
00:08:00,144 --> 00:08:15,046
I wonder if I liked both of them.

31
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:30,132
It's left. This is a good point of view.

32
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:45,047
Where is that next? It's about time.

33
00:08:45,047 --> 00:09:00,139
It's the next 3rd round. I wonder if I want to go to Goupan poorly.

Another one entered. Speed ​​Let's eat something. Eat soba. Tomorrow is the match Himeji.

46
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:30,056

93
00:24:45,137 --> 00:25:00,134
On my screen, it's Olympus. It's full, right now, right now. Is it 5 times divided into 5 teams? It will be a different place from the fence.

102
00:27:15,157 --> 00:27:30,138
Did you get ready and wait for 3 minutes? That's a different feeling, 3 minutes and 40 seconds. Another person or something. 40 seconds Not Mr. Dubdora.

103
00:27:30,138 --> 00:27:45,059

115
00:30:30,118 --> 00:30:45,154
Well, I have a tail and I want three. I have two sweets, so I want two. It's 8 because I'm 3. What is a thank you ball?

00:30:45,154 --> 00:31:00,119
It's okay now. I will collect it.

117
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:15,148
Well then, for me, this isn't the case, but I've got a bee. It's OK since it started. What is this? Only 8 can be taken. This is pressure.

118
00:31:15,148 --> 00:31:30,134

121
00:32:00,164 --> 00:32:15,157
I was late, but it's okay, isn't it? I'm not thinking of going. It's early.

122
00:32:15,157 --> 00:32:30,095
Then I'm looking forward to what to do. If possible, take the upper side.

123
00:32:30,095 --> 00:32:45,103
That's the plum here. Isn't it food? That's right.

124
00:32:45,103 --> 00:33:00,136
It's okay to stay at that house. For the time being, take them all.

125
00:33:00,136 --> 00:33:15,158
Does Hiro have this? I think this is the direction. May come or come.

127
00:33:30,144 --> 00:33:45,120
Cook the strongest house dome. I wonder if it was expensive to see that.

128
00:33:45,120 --> 00:34:00,180
I don't know if it's a car or not. I think the car stayed a lot earlier. A hanging flower. I haven't heard anything about my family yet.

00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:15,074
camera.

130
00:34:15,074 --> 00:34:30,102
Still take the gorilla. I wonder if I'm at the end of this portal.

131
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:45,146
There are times when I'm a cat, purple.

132
00:34:45,146 --> 00:35:00,112
cyberduck I wonder who took it.

133
00:35:00,112 --> 00:35:15,154
I'm watching this now. I want to see this already.

134
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:30,118
Right now, there is one breath in the Shuriken City roost. Emi Takei Kenichi Nishi. Fortune-teller Syringe Wagon R. I think I keep it at your house that suits you first.

135
00:35:30,118 --> 00:35:45,134
You should go there for a moment I wonder if it's okay to stay here. I think it comes from here.

136
00:35:45,134 --> 00:36:00,146
It's not a race where everyone is here. I should be doing it. Black granita. asbestos.

137
00:36:00,146 --> 00:36:15,118
I'm vacant here. I can't see it from here.

138
00:36:15,118 --> 00:36:30,109
Where is the distance that makes you fall like that? Is it around here?

139
00:36:30,109 --> 00:36:45,128
It must have fallen. It's not the strongest, right? There are still people, right? Can you see only one?

140
00:36:45,128 --> 00:37:00,137
I don't feel it. Not good. I understand this. Look only here I'll take a peek from here Once we don't move.

141
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:15,091
Something worked, but now. I can't see the back.

142
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:30,089
This may be the strongest or it may be out of focus.

143
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:45,126
I don't need it. Brown Jib Archer Raijang.

144
00:37:45,126 --> 00:38:00,099
I wonder if I didn't fall in love.

145
00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:15,132
Okayama: I think it's easier to make if you're in the middle. There's nothing pretty much because I've seen it over here for now.

146
00:38:15,132 --> 00:38:30,206
I saw it over there Suddenly it's strong even if it's clear from the top, so it's the best because it's the timing to descend from the top to the bottom, so I wonder if the timing of the scan of Satte Hatagasaki is the strongest Isn't there a window even if I enter the house? I wonder if he will play with me.

147
00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:45,122
I can see I can't see Top 1. I don't know.

148
00:38:45,122 --> 00:39:00,124
Horizon Gacha. KREVA. Kewpie is doing it.

149
00:39:00,124 --> 00:39:15,115
That worst. Let's go for a moment.

150
00:39:15,115 --> 00:39:30,114
It's better to move fluidly from here. There is nothing better than this.

151
00:39:30,114 --> 00:39:45,096
With the team that was stuffed with Nakane. Another team will join 3 teams over there.

152
00:39:45,096 --> 00:40:00,116
I see, you have to run out now. A fish containing the one that was just awakened.

153
00:40:00,116 --> 00:40:15,160
Flying Flying Don't come over here. Let me practice this alone.

154
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:30,123
I started wearing it in the morning when it stretched sideways. Chara 2 is amazing.

155
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:45,128
Tires come to work to recover a little.

156
00:40:45,128 --> 00:41:00,145
I think this is Mr. Fukuzawa. I'm telling you.

157
00:41:00,145 --> 00:41:15,155
I wonder if it's still there. What about from this tip?

158
00:41:15,155 --> 00:41:30,131
Climbed distance I climbed. Is it impossible unless it is a horizon? Here are Fubuki-san.

159
00:41:30,131 --> 00:41:45,046
I want to take on a super challenge.

160
00:41:45,046 --> 00:42:15,112
I think I'm still there. Don't make holes in LINE.

161
00:42:15,112 --> 00:42:30,171
There are 3 people in Mr. Taue, 3 people, 3 bodies were detected. Mirage Mirage. What was this?

162
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:45,118
If you have a body 91 The one here. Glen.

163
00:42:45,118 --> 00:43:00,155
Sankyo House Yada is the strongest, so I'm taking it, but I've noticed it now. The brush here may also come.

164
00:43:00,155 --> 00:43:30,125
Not in the car. I could get on by car if I had free time. It's technical.

165
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:45,129
It's kind of weird. I might enter this side. You can be hit with a little care.

166
00:43:45,129 --> 00:44:00,152
With this, I can't climb big. I'm thinking like PUBG. Right now, we're working part-time at the house we were originally from.

167
00:44:00,152 --> 00:44:15,120
You should come. thought. Alien Alien. I wonder if I don't have to do that much this time.

168
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:30,099
You can do it, right? We're doing it now at the house we were originally in **. From here, Fussa Letanne. Should I take it?

169
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:45,118
It's really messed up.

170
00:44:45,118 --> 00:45:00,204
If two people enter one step higher than Potter, it will be there and HORIZON will be bad. Behind the scenes where I started doing it.

171
00:45:00,204 --> 00:45:15,113
Super delicious tongue salt. Easy Housing Plaza Nishio.

172
00:45:15,113 --> 00:45:30,155
I'm not here, I want you to take it differently and say it only once. I ran away alone. There is no cha-cha-cha.

173
00:45:30,155 --> 00:45:45,135
Cannula.

174
00:45:45,135 --> 00:46:00,121
Burnable thread before burning.

175
00:46:00,121 --> 00:46:15,105
Did you make a mistake here?

176
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:45,125
OK I'm waiting.

177
00:46:45,125 --> 00:47:00,145
It's different. From here.

178
00:47:00,145 --> 00:47:15,125
I want to sit down, but it's impossible.

179
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:30,163
It's a little together. I just found it. OK 8 pieces are all right. I was dispatched from a strange place because I could fit in here. That's from home.

180
00:47:30,163 --> 00:47:45,162
This is this. Just do it, do it.

181
00:47:45,162 --> 00:48:00,125
It's not big, it's big. Completely pitch black Thank you.

182
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:15,149
I'm already messed up with shuriken. I want to wind it completely.

183
00:48:15,149 --> 00:48:30,146
This is a good way to sing. Don't come this.

184
00:48:30,146 --> 00:48:45,109
I entered it. I don't think Gibraltar is in it if we can get it. How will I get up?

185
00:48:45,109 --> 00:49:00,145
It seems that it is sold by Toride from the top. A boxer with 180. 20 seconds left.

186
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:15,122
At the end, it feels like a tea plant. 4 Stage. With the upper left.

187
00:49:15,122 --> 00:49:30,085
It will start. It's a little to hold a thrown object. I wonder if. You should discuss the Move of Tochigi.

188
00:49:30,085 --> 00:49:45,092
Planting trees are not selling. I'm waiting here I'm waiting here I'm waiting here

189
00:49:45,092 --> 00:50:00,128
About Poco Poco. This is Takiron Hiraihari Now I'm sticking to something like a shellfish. I don't.

190
00:50:00,128 --> 00:50:15,105
I have to come this far. You can cook it already. There is no choice but to win the battle.

191
00:50:15,105 --> 00:50:30,116
It got so dark that we couldn't get it for the first time. Friday Road.

192
00:50:30,116 --> 00:50:45,054
grain.

193
00:50:45,054 --> 00:51:00,044
How nice.

194
00:51:00,044 --> 00:51:30,134
I'm a little dancer next to the lowest height. Where is it?

195
00:51:30,134 --> 00:51:45,169
It should have flowed. Somehow, only Saki-chan, who is Kirby there, came a little different, and there was a gold pattern next to it, and there was something LINE at the bottom.

196
00:51:45,169 --> 00:52:00,110
7 kill kill.

197
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:15,088
Osanpo Osanpo Move.

198
00:52:15,088 --> 00:52:30,098
I will do more. It's okay because the rain is fun. I wonder if it's about another minute.

199
00:52:30,098 --> 00:52:45,123
What's going on with this since I'm rebuilding? Really. Where is the team you beat on the left? At the current bicycle.

200
00:52:45,123 --> 00:53:00,093
I should have told you earlier. When I was in the house, the action after that was so fast.

201
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:15,172
Process it quickly. In terms of points, it was a waste of time, so it's definitely one point. Besides, it's good that it is taken by other teams.

202
00:53:15,172 --> 00:53:30,150
Ueno team was taken. Because I put it in my mouth. Teka Mare To be honest, I couldn't keep up with that moment.

203
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:45,167
Well, I think it wasn't good that I was interested in the left heights in the first place. I didn't eat to get out of there. In an area where the other party did not come here either.

204
00:53:45,167 --> 00:54:00,140
I wanted to cut it. I want to get a quilt that I can definitely get. Yeah, it was 9 earlier.
