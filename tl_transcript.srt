1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:17:46,642
Hololive with a good icon I can definitely hear it more than I don't know.

2
00:17:46,642 --> 00:18:01,618
It's hard for Haruo-san to think that he can do something about it, but the camera frame isn't strange.

3
00:18:01,618 --> 00:18:16,614
Leia's comment I haven't put it out. When I talked to a boy who talked about something. I heard that it takes a lot of time to read.

4
00:18:16,614 --> 00:18:31,571
I thought it might be the cause. tried.

5
00:18:31,571 --> 00:18:46,660
People who haven't put it in I thought I'd go there once, and it seems like it's going to get messed up in the time it takes to read. Because I can't do it, I'm saying that there is a possibility that it will stick together, so once.

6
00:18:46,660 --> 00:19:01,586
If I add a maximum frame rate, I'll use it for a while. It's bright red.

7
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:16,612
If you turn this on and control the FPS to about sub 200, something different. But it didn't heal. See you earlier.

8
00:19:16,612 --> 00:19:31,612
Good but I can see the comments I just haven't seen them. I'm watching the comments Hello everyone. I'm writing it and going home.

9
00:19:31,612 --> 00:19:46,619
Please bring it back.

10
00:19:46,619 --> 00:20:01,586
Of graphics. Art friend. Vertical sync is off.

11
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:16,622
63 is lighter because I made it normal.

12
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:31,633
How much maximum frame. Where is that? With this or this.

13
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:46,606
If you try this once a little and it seems to be stupid, think again.

14
00:20:46,606 --> 00:21:01,620
Somehow, it shouldn't be scratched even if the shader isn't scraped.

15
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:16,611
Don't lose the image quality because it's once. I wonder how light it will be. Major cheap and expensive.

16
00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:46,570
It's all on the other display, isn't it? I'm doing it, but I put it out for screen confirmation. Round and round.

17
00:21:46,570 --> 00:22:01,615
Because YouTube 3 goes round and round. My monitor 31.5 type. Now it's 27 type.

18
00:22:01,615 --> 00:22:16,574
Type 5 is too big. The monitor is a little tiny.

19
00:22:16,574 --> 00:22:31,612
Was it Michael Yotsugi?

20
00:22:31,612 --> 00:22:46,565
I've cleaned it up. I'm sorry.

21
00:22:46,565 --> 00:23:01,629
I'm sorry I ranted to my friend for a moment. She's also a beautiful woman. Because it's a solo.

22
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:16,567
Little by little little by little.

23
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:31,611
Not yet here. Couldn't it rotate? Where can I still go home?

24
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:46,599
Michael. Suspicion Suspicion.

25
00:23:46,599 --> 00:24:01,569
I'm driving a car today.

26
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:16,587
It's not a map.

27
00:24:16,587 --> 00:24:31,586
I thought it was blue cheese.

28
00:24:31,586 --> 00:24:46,612
Chat app. I'm scared to see this and somehow understand.

29
00:24:46,612 --> 00:25:01,614
Don't quarrel, stop.

30
00:25:01,614 --> 00:25:16,529
Thanks.

31
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:31,643
Second-hand chicks I wonder if I'll win if I get lost and say something around me.

32
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:46,640
It's too early for me to go home myself.

33
00:25:46,640 --> 00:26:01,605
School CM. I can't eat it, but I feel like it's been a while.

34
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:16,580
A house that I like. My son is in Saga.

35
00:26:16,580 --> 00:27:01,602
Nogure meaning.

36
00:27:01,602 --> 00:27:16,596
Gal Blow.

37
00:27:16,596 --> 00:27:31,634
Piano Trevor The first thing was that the impact was too strong, and the atmosphere was quite messy. I started to feel awkward with the timer.

38
00:27:31,634 --> 00:27:46,616
The cleaning lady is ready to eat even when she is killed.

39
00:27:46,616 --> 00:28:01,579
You were here. The gecko is at home.

40
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:16,551
I'm sorry for that.

41
00:28:16,551 --> 00:28:31,566
You can look like that.

42
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:46,577
I just can't do that job. I changed my schedule.

43
00:28:46,577 --> 00:29:31,612
I could only see it for a moment. Keep the signal and both hands are noisy. The one who has the signal is other than me.

44
00:29:31,612 --> 00:29:46,565
Play BGM properly. But there is a little BGM.

45
00:29:46,565 --> 00:30:01,574
It is flowing from the speaker. I didn't hear it from the speaker.

46
00:30:01,574 --> 00:30:31,610
I thought it would be better to have a block.

47
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:46,586
I'm sorry.

48
00:30:46,586 --> 00:31:01,588
Everyone is speeding up and stepping on the accelerator of the trailer.

49
00:31:01,588 --> 00:31:16,573
It doesn't bend suddenly, so I'm accelerating a little. Hair loss. You can tell from the fact that you are on the side of the umbrella, but it's a driving school.

50
00:31:16,573 --> 00:31:31,634
I thought which person would say the kanji that came with me, but the prices.

51
00:31:31,634 --> 00:31:46,602
Small. It's okay.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:32:03,506
It 's good.

53
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:18,551
I just taught you.

54
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:33,597
It was hot though. For the time being, I'm gonna grab a very beautiful cat.

55
00:32:33,597 --> 00:33:03,548
This is that. Together with Trevor.

56
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:17,485
Fine.

57
00:33:17,485 --> 00:33:33,584
Trevor's action that I saw for the first time even with a poop attack.

58
00:33:33,584 --> 00:33:48,558
It became a tropical abbreviation.

59
00:33:48,558 --> 00:34:33,607
Do you want to leave your daughter? Should I say it by car?

60
00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:48,577
That his car.

61
00:34:48,577 --> 00:35:03,558
Truck driver Dora video.

62
00:35:03,558 --> 00:35:18,541
Rather Nacchan.

63
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:33,558
Okay, this freed house Where did you go?

64
00:35:33,558 --> 00:35:48,592
I felt like I was out It was too late.

65
00:35:48,592 --> 00:36:03,588
But I cut it off, but I cut it off.

66
00:36:03,588 --> 00:36:18,538
hot. Can I not separate it?

67
00:36:18,538 --> 00:36:33,602
I wonder if it can't be separated until it comes out.

68
00:36:33,602 --> 00:36:48,575
The author who is different from 2 is not in the way anymore.

69
00:36:48,575 --> 00:37:03,577
Only difficult vehicles will come one after another.

70
00:37:03,577 --> 00:37:18,571
How did you kill me

71
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:33,559
Chirihama.

72
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:48,530
Heavy truck license. Come on online together. I'll kill you.

73
00:37:48,530 --> 00:38:03,582
I can't separate it.

74
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:18,523
The rest will follow.

75
00:38:18,523 --> 00:38:33,569
You can't make a bump. You can't hit it.

76
00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:48,508
Was saved. It was regrettable.

77
00:38:48,508 --> 00:39:03,641
What is the timing of turning a large car?

78
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:33,595
One step before the milk teeth. Chung Chocochoco-chan.

79
00:39:33,595 --> 00:39:48,587
Catch up with a little bit. There is no longer a collision.

80
00:39:48,587 --> 00:40:03,610
I broke the signal I broke one What happens to the signal factory.

81
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:18,567
I lose track of it. I don't know what that means.

82
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:33,561
The act of running on the railroad tracks is dangerous. Even if you lay it with the accelerator fully open.

83
00:40:33,561 --> 00:40:48,537
It feels like going to this fish on the truck.

84
00:40:48,537 --> 00:41:03,552
That red car that can still dance stands out. The card is not fast.

85
00:41:03,552 --> 00:41:18,531
I wonder if I should keep up with it instead of hitting it.

86
00:41:18,531 --> 00:41:33,587
TV. It may be tight.

87
00:41:33,587 --> 00:41:48,534
Where did you go? I swear this person.

88
00:41:48,534 --> 00:42:03,609
I wonder if this is a mat, isn't it? End the guidance.

89
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:18,549
It was the correct answer because I was chasing after everyone.

90
00:42:18,549 --> 00:42:33,542
I'm sorry confession Forgive me because I'm the criminal. I'm sorry to forgive you.

91
00:42:33,542 --> 00:43:03,598
I'm sorry I chased cocoa. The person in the middle was a second cousin.

92
00:43:03,598 --> 00:43:33,560
Can you be chased? Is it good?

93
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:48,579
Because of you and Micra, I'm trying to expand this distance.

94
00:43:48,579 --> 00:44:03,577
I was on my lap.

95
00:44:03,577 --> 00:44:18,553
Maybe it will switch on.

96
00:44:18,553 --> 00:44:33,590
I'll tell everyone if it will come out. I wonder if I can take it off a little.

97
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:48,580
I'll tell you what kind of player Takegami is.

98
00:44:48,580 --> 00:45:03,562
I can't take off those pants.

99
00:45:03,562 --> 00:45:33,617
I'm dancing in briefs. I'm sorry.

100
00:45:33,617 --> 00:45:48,589
I was cold sweating. I wondered what to do. Maybe it's okay to show it too.

101
00:45:48,589 --> 00:46:03,619
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

102
00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:18,556
In the upper right. I was wondering what it was, but it looks like a member rush.

103
00:46:18,556 --> 00:46:33,626
I was just looking for a song. Autosave found man already exists in the slot.

104
00:46:33,626 --> 00:46:48,518
Something like no game.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:47:04,476
Next is Trevor.

106
00:47:04,476 --> 00:47:34,480
It's like this, and it's just a face. What is this when you are not in the vehicle behind the car?

107
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:49,471
This may not have been related to messing around. I don't think so.

108
00:47:49,471 --> 00:48:04,376
twenty three. sorry.

109
00:48:04,376 --> 00:48:19,421
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry. The sound of the truck.

110
00:48:19,421 --> 00:48:34,430
In such a case, a collision accident happened, but it just happened.

111
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:49,435
What and why did you come home? I'll turn back later.

112
00:48:49,435 --> 00:49:04,492
sorry. I've been there for about 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years. I will not be the inquirer.

113
00:49:04,492 --> 00:49:19,441
The police won't move even if they hit me like this.

114
00:49:19,441 --> 00:49:34,464
I wonder if that is something. I wonder if I play a catch-type game every day.

115
00:49:34,464 --> 00:49:49,494
Here when I was Michael. I ran around the sea.

116
00:49:49,494 --> 00:50:04,445
That when I stopped at Michael's parking lot. I'm sorry.

117
00:50:04,445 --> 00:50:19,446
I haven't stopped yet, but he says he'll break while trying to do so.

118
00:50:19,446 --> 00:50:34,469
It's like this area. Isn't it here?

119
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:49,382
back.

120
00:50:49,382 --> 00:51:04,462
Oh yeah here here I remember here. Hello.

121
00:51:04,462 --> 00:51:19,474
You too are me. Trevor isn't noisy.

122
00:51:19,474 --> 00:51:34,461
From here, what's sensitive is that your boobs are round. Let me see only the naked man.

123
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:49,437
Because I'm a little more full. I don't want to scare it.

124
00:51:49,437 --> 00:52:04,495
I'm scared to die.

125
00:52:04,495 --> 00:52:19,412
I'm already an adult. I'm going to sleep. telop.

126
00:52:19,412 --> 00:52:34,497
I didn't really want it at 9 o'clock. Toyota era.

127
00:52:34,497 --> 00:52:49,430
After pulling it out once, it's so white and surreal.

128
00:52:49,430 --> 00:53:04,469
Well, it's okay to make a reservation for a while, maybe once. Did the car suddenly take off his pants? Wear Kanuma pants.

129
00:53:04,469 --> 00:53:19,455
But I have to do it easily.

130
00:53:19,455 --> 00:53:34,433
Does that bear have any meaning?

131
00:53:34,433 --> 00:54:04,432
Will you work tomorrow? Somehow.

132
00:54:04,432 --> 00:54:19,417
Senkyu Senkyu 2nd term.

133
00:54:19,417 --> 00:54:34,433
Suddenly it's no longer a truck. what will you do.

134
00:54:34,433 --> 00:54:49,473
It's really time to leave the office.

135
00:54:49,473 --> 00:55:04,438
It seems that the company is very crowded only in the direction of returning from the company.

136
00:55:04,438 --> 00:55:19,428
Wait a minute for the car to stab. To keep you from getting bored.

137
00:55:19,428 --> 00:55:34,458
The sound of this mission. It's brilliant. It was a mission without knowing it at all.

138
00:55:34,458 --> 00:55:49,486
Why why why why

139
00:55:49,486 --> 00:56:04,453
Even if you look at the subtitles, it will be like this. I think I can do this. I can't do this.

140
00:56:04,453 --> 00:56:19,480
I thought I could go here, but it was above.

141
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:34,468
Something like a comment. There is such a thing.

142
00:56:34,468 --> 00:56:49,471
It may be dropped. Everyone was shaken off the car.

143
00:56:49,471 --> 00:57:04,435
There is no choice but to climb here. The road.

144
00:57:04,435 --> 00:57:19,425
It wasn't good that the truck hit. It's a good idea to run.

145
00:57:19,425 --> 00:57:34,469
I don't think so. I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry.

146
00:57:34,469 --> 00:57:49,441
Super moon. Of Ran Ito.

147
00:57:49,441 --> 00:58:04,478
It's easier to work, isn't it? I don't need a sign in the GTA world.

148
00:58:04,478 --> 00:58:19,415
It pops off.

149
00:58:19,415 --> 00:58:34,476
Why did you choose Tomomi? Norimi Minagawa and Shintaro Car navigation and distortion While looking at the map at the bottom left, my legs. There is no choice but to put yellow on it, everyone.

150
00:58:34,476 --> 00:59:04,454
Is it soon? It's a little useless because it's the top.

151
00:59:04,454 --> 00:59:19,420
I'll put it in the back.

152
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:34,460
Someone dangerously again.

153
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:49,452
I went to work.

154
00:59:49,452 --> 01:00:04,463
I'm sorry. I was told something. I'm sorry for the time being.

155
01:00:04,463 --> 01:00:19,374
It was.

156
01:00:19,374 --> 01:00:34,435
This is okay to be connected with everyone.

157
01:00:34,435 --> 01:00:49,419
If you act together. Floyd NTV. By all means.

158
01:00:49,419 --> 01:01:04,466
Shiranui flare part 2 that I really want to go inside. That kind of guy.

159
01:01:04,466 --> 01:01:19,476
Jelena is scary. Will you be a monzennaka?

160
01:01:19,476 --> 01:01:34,479
The day after tomorrow, I'll follow you a little. I'm not a suspicious person. That's it.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 01:02:06,325
However. Look at your right hand.

162
01:02:06,325 --> 01:02:21,358
Really move it.

163
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:51,329
Move the container directly above with eroticism.

164
01:02:51,329 --> 01:03:06,333
I really want to move you. A game where you can experience various jobs.

165
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:21,377
I wonder if I should go to the green area. This is okay for a father who was shot by someone.

166
01:03:21,377 --> 01:03:36,367
A place I don't know. I was killed. Wasn't it quick to give it to the container?

167
01:03:36,367 --> 01:03:51,422
Work experience school.

168
01:03:51,422 --> 01:04:06,378
The container here.

169
01:04:06,378 --> 01:04:21,379
Because the location is slightly different depending on how much you move with one.

170
01:04:21,379 --> 01:04:36,375
This is a little heavier than this. This is the one with only this one. I want to borrow it.

171
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:51,384
You're going to get fired from work.

172
01:04:51,384 --> 01:05:06,418
Moreover, it was good that the container remained below. There is no place.

173
01:05:06,418 --> 01:05:21,394
What should I do? This is the bottom.

174
01:05:21,394 --> 01:05:36,386
Crane game image. Crane game.

175
01:05:36,386 --> 01:05:51,351
Grab something like a grab. grab.

176
01:05:51,351 --> 01:06:06,377
Unload the container. The heels have become slanted.

177
01:06:06,377 --> 01:06:21,397
It's straight. so much.

178
01:06:21,397 --> 01:06:36,338
I'm happy at the mall. A little distance Take a little distance.

179
01:06:36,338 --> 01:06:51,351
I've arrived in this world.

180
01:06:51,351 --> 01:07:06,298
I did a little too much. toy. this.

181
01:07:06,298 --> 01:07:21,388
You don't really respect me, are you a little drunk?

182
01:07:21,388 --> 01:07:36,412
Strict care crane game, even a little. Super strict.

183
01:07:36,412 --> 01:08:36,362
container. Come on naturally when you go to something. L button Left L button.

184
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:51,341
I don't think it's necessary, but it's definitely necessary.

185
01:08:51,341 --> 01:09:06,377
Even the rabbit is at that yellow person.

186
01:09:06,377 --> 01:09:21,359
with this. That was a bad shit.
