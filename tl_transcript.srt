00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:48,356
If you were going to the stars. The place where the ship went crazy and crashed. Where life is difficult.

7
00:01:48,356 --> 00:02:03,354
Even if I comb it, it's still squishy. Something like an Avex Pathfinder like a Pathfinder. Ummm.

8
00:02:03,354 --> 00:02:18,330
They say that they will make a life. There is no sapling.

9
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:33,321
I'm from anime. roulette. Leon.

10

I'm sorry than Kyoto. Something. What is a simple study?

19
00:05:48,309 --> 00:06:03,358
It's easy to use. On the contrary, it's like studying. Not that.

20
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:48,324
Well what? 3.

21
00:06:48,324 --> 00:07:18,330
Is that so or so? Is the aisle setting fast?

22
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:33,317
3 You should talk about four, I'm sure.

23
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:48,305
Talk 2 here.

24
00:07:48,305 --> 00:08:33,295
And this time it's already in. It was good.

25
00:08:33,295 --> 00:09:18,263
In voice.

26
00:09:18,263 --> 00:09:33,334

30
00:10:33,330 --> 00:11:33,303
It's not close.

31
00:11:33,303 --> 00:11:48,341
It's going well, isn't it growing quickly? I hope this is included.

32
00:11:48,341 --> 00:12:03,358
There are variations in Nico's growth, so I'm sure it's okay.

33
00:12:03,358 --> 00:12:18,347
Please grow up quickly.

34
00:12:18,347 --> 00:12:33,279
Yes. I think I can go.

35
00:12:33,279 --> 00:13:03,298
How nice. Because it's a big deal. Because it's wide.

36
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:18,328
The rest is just to grow another tree in that profession. Are you going to exchange emeralds?

37
00:13:18,328 --> 00:13:33,331
My butt hurts. My SHIP. break.

38
00:13:33,331 --> 00:13:48,242

Japanese.

42
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:30,658
Yuzu phrase. The bath broke.

43
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:45,677
Fracture of the buttocks. Chronic.

44
00:16:45,677 --> 00:17:00,693

45
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:30,682
YES Chronic.

46
00:17:30,682 --> 00:18:00,653
What do you say

47
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:15,710
I just wanted to bring an emerald.

48
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:30,648
chronic.

49
00:18:30,648 --> 00:18:45,596
Chronic.

50
00:18:45,596 --> 00:19:00,664
I raised the level.

51
00:19:00,664 --> 00:19:30,727
A shield with one emerald.

52
00:19:30,727 --> 00:20:00,691
My Boo. Pain Pain Pain.

53
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:15,625
Spain.

00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:30,609
2.

55
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:45,667
Yes body defeat I want to know.

56
00:20:45,667 --> 00:21:15,690
I came to import it.

57
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:45,647
Rice import.

58
00:21:45,647 --> 00:22:15,661
Since then, the terrible pain has disappeared at all.

59
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:30,665
Cross-legged on a chair. On the chair.

60
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:45,648
It's fine to sit like a tree. It.

61
00:22:45,648 --> 00:23:00,605
sticker.

62
00:23:00,605 --> 00:23:15,677
Final level up.

63
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:30,694
I'm an expert. Let's go down one step. Didn't all come out? All this will come out.

64
00:23:30,694 --> 00:24:00,704
I don't want to. I don't need it, but it's a waste, so wait.

65
00:24:00,704 --> 00:24:15,674
That wasn't it. I was trying to make a little.

66
00:24:15,674 --> 00:24:45,670
Here.

67
00:24:45,670 --> 00:25:00,663
In a big box. I don't buy it.

68
00:25:00,663 --> 00:25:30,649
I hate you. tool.

69
00:25:30,649 --> 00:26:00,699
This is inconvenient.

70
00:26:00,699 --> 00:26:15,686
The schoolyard is burned by a lightning strike. It's the same with wooden structures.

71
00:26:15,686 --> 00:26:45,654
Don't break it, come on. I'm sleeping in English.

72
00:26:45,654 --> 00:27:00,708
If you can read it.

73
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:15,608
12.

74
00:27:15,608 --> 00:27:45,687
Ken Naoko. It would be fun to read it.

75
00:27:45,687 --> 00:28:00,678
This person. This knight English too. Tet evaluation I understand.

76
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:15,725
I'm suspicious.

77
00:28:15,725 --> 00:29:15,671
Then let me go home and tell me.

78
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:45,706
It's not white. Please purchase. Today's trade is over.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:30:16,485
Hey hey. Last. This is fine for the time being.

80
00:30:16,485 --> 00:30:31,462
Congratulations! Is this the only way to do my best in the first step from Minamitakae?

81
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:47,507
I'm being pushed.

82
00:30:47,507 --> 00:31:17,502
32 bells?

83
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:31,481
Maybe that's it. Iron ax for about 4 gauge sentences.

84
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:46,418
9.

85
00:31:46,418 --> 00:32:17,505
What do you call a cow?

86
00:32:17,505 --> 00:32:31,413
Is it already?

87
00:32:31,413 --> 00:32:46,492
Not anymore.

88
00:32:46,492 --> 00:33:16,485
Miles on Suica?

89
00:33:16,485 --> 00:33:31,412
me.

90
00:33:31,412 --> 00:34:01,455
It's great.

91
00:34:01,455 --> 00:34:16,471
Do you have Siri anymore?

92
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:32,506
Somehow, I know.

93
00:34:32,506 --> 00:34:46,491
Fixed punch came to sell cards. It was run by Grandpa right away. I'm already full.

94
00:34:46,491 --> 00:35:01,456
I won't buy it. I'm full.

95
00:35:01,456 --> 00:35:31,487
I wonder what he is. Let's change trains. It's a rip-off.

96
00:35:31,487 --> 00:36:01,464
Same thing. I was struck. This is subtle.

97
00:36:01,464 --> 00:36:31,442
One person.

98
00:36:31,442 --> 00:37:01,402
It is being avoided.

99
00:37:01,402 --> 00:38:02,517
Ah spicy this. Let's reverse it. A gravel flavor that speaks with a lucky pickaxe.

100
00:38:02,517 --> 00:38:16,471
Why is the emerald that I have worked hard to save?

101
00:38:16,471 --> 00:38:31,496
Still chest. Because the emerald is infinite by the pumpkin Sui script.

102
00:38:31,496 --> 00:38:46,478
This is this. It's a great past.

103
00:38:46,478 --> 00:39:02,514
It's strange. Guarana Live.

104
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:31,481
That's it. Then I'm trying to cut it.

105
00:39:31,481 --> 00:40:01,411
Extremely.

106
00:40:01,411 --> 00:40:16,470
I don't know at all, but I pretend I know English. surely.

107
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:31,489
Environmental problems. That's a pretty difficult place.

108
00:40:31,489 --> 00:41:01,474
Is it on the top?

109
00:41:01,474 --> 00:41:16,462
Yes. It's especially good.

110
00:41:16,462 --> 00:41:31,487
I don't need it anymore. Silk-touch shovel What can you do?

111
00:41:31,487 --> 00:41:46,465
But let's go slowly.

112
00:41:46,465 --> 00:42:01,478
I've never had a problem with this because it might come out if I do this.

113
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:16,478
I'm not good at it. It's loved by God.

114
00:42:16,478 --> 00:42:31,458
You tried to go home, but you tried to go home. Maybe one more time next time. That's why I went now.

115
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:46,469
Rice toothpaste. I'm drunk.

116
00:42:46,469 --> 00:43:16,496
It's amazing. Then do you go get it?

117
00:43:16,496 --> 00:43:31,466
I wonder where it is.

118
00:43:31,466 --> 00:43:47,510
I got 18 cookies with 2 emeralds.

119
00:43:47,510 --> 00:44:16,479
But is the purchase finished?

120
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:47,519
It's Mebuki.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:45:03,308
Are you a scammer too? Are you a scammer too?

122
00:45:03,308 --> 00:45:33,316
I can't forgive you in Nomura.

123
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:48,313
Really.

124
00:45:48,313 --> 00:46:03,316
You can't do that. I don't think it looks kind.

125
00:46:03,316 --> 00:46:18,323
Don't be crazy. It's a scam if you're side by side here too.

126
00:46:18,323 --> 00:46:33,344
There are only scammers. Connoisseur. Even though it was such a gentle kotatsu.

127
00:46:33,344 --> 00:46:48,308
Why have people changed? From the poor. I'm squeezing it.

128
00:46:48,308 --> 00:47:18,323
Only you guys. Gentle Gentle One person tearing.

129
00:47:18,323 --> 00:47:48,245
What do you do now?

130
00:47:48,245 --> 00:48:03,419
There are too many west scammers. I can't cut those scammers. If you dig gravel with another 3 pickaxe scoops.

131
00:48:03,419 --> 00:48:18,342
Father confirmed ship this.

132
00:48:18,342 --> 00:48:33,328
Can be collected in large quantities. It's like work.

133
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:48,310
I'm sure it is. Is this confirmed by 3?

134
00:48:48,310 --> 00:49:03,333
Thank you for always streaming and I support you.

135
00:49:03,333 --> 00:49:18,260
I want to know the defeat.

136
00:49:18,260 --> 00:50:03,307
It's time to die.

137
00:50:03,307 --> 00:50:18,317
It's on the ground. It's hard.

138
00:50:18,317 --> 00:50:33,285
I can't really say that. I'm sleeping at some house.

139
00:50:33,285 --> 00:50:48,283
Kimono is also a thing. I make it.

140
00:50:48,283 --> 00:51:03,351
I'm thinking. That kind of thing.

141
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:48,303
garbage. Still Soka. Geology.

142
00:51:48,303 --> 00:52:03,356
You can't get a diamond ax, don't you go pumpkin? Get a diamond ax.

143
00:52:03,356 --> 00:52:33,337
White flower. From today on price and surgery. A diamond weapon made once.

144
00:52:33,337 --> 00:52:48,315
I know you.

145
00:52:48,315 --> 00:53:03,231
Hey.

146
00:53:03,231 --> 00:53:33,284

00:53:48,305 --> 00:54:03,301
I'm going. OK.

149
00:54:03,301 --> 00:54:33,305
Did you come out? One more time. I can't eat it anymore.

150
00:54:33,305 --> 00:54:48,324
Anymore. Multi.

151
00:54:48,324 --> 00:55:03,305
Multi. Allot of meaning.

152
00:55:03,305 --> 00:55:18,314
Alot of Mini. First. can't eat any more.

153
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:33,288
second. I'M very happy.

154
00:55:33,288 --> 00:56:03,314
Wen I'm Berry Happy.

155
00:56:03,314 --> 00:56:33,296
I tend to say it in my sleep.

156
00:56:33,296 --> 00:57:03,309
Difficult Berry Difficult.

157
00:57:03,309 --> 00:57:18,362
Money. I made too much money.

158
00:57:18,362 --> 00:57:33,355
I can't eat it. I.

159
00:57:33,355 --> 00:57:48,333
When you are satisfied with washing. When you are satisfied with everything.

160
00:57:48,333 --> 00:58:33,308
The last ax on the sleeve, wasn't he a master?

161
00:58:33,308 --> 00:58:48,292
I've got a ken, this is already good.

162
00:58:48,292 --> 00:59:03,334
It's dangerous. You can't exchange it. Three irons are fine.

163
00:59:03,334 --> 00:59:18,338
It's 6 o'clock.

164
00:59:18,338 --> 00:59:33,327
Nobody knows the possible places anymore.

165
00:59:33,327 --> 00:59:48,243
Tours.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,257
Guidance Iron Iron Golem Trap Project.

167
01:00:05,257 --> 01:00:20,219
Seriously.

168
01:00:20,219 --> 01:00:35,213
10 Golem Trap If villagers enter. I can do it.

169
01:00:35,213 --> 01:00:50,188
Somehow it doesn't seem to work.

170
01:00:50,188 --> 01:01:05,218
that. Grahan So make a village judgment. Be sure to open it in place. I'm sure it's just a matter of time.

171
01:01:05,218 --> 01:01:20,183
In the swamp. You have to make sure you don't understand something. My wind.

172
01:01:20,183 --> 01:01:35,256
Golem Wakanakamura had a specification like the sky in the center, isn't it? Something like a zombie.

173
01:01:35,256 --> 01:01:50,236
Increase the chances that villagers will be frightened by showing or hiding.

174
01:01:50,236 --> 01:02:05,240
Is it easier to get up? While sleeping.

175
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:20,214

Defeat.
