1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:34,763
Here and here is 5 years.

2
00:00:34,763 --> 00:00:49,766
This is 9. This is 9. You can't put it here.

3
00:00:49,766 --> 00:01:04,765
From here, maybe even a coarse range isn't okay.

4
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:19,787
Bishop. I want to go along.

5
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:34,762
The stairs aren't there for the time being. The guy who forgets to take it, fix this.

6
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:49,736
Up there up there. 123-4.

7
00:01:49,736 --> 00:02:04,748
It looks like it's It looks like a charo.

8
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:19,764
It looks like you're eating. No. No, no.

9
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:34,778
But this is where the colors come in many colors.

10
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:49,721
is correct.

11
00:02:49,721 --> 00:03:04,783
I'm waiting for 5 o'clock every time.

12
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:19,808
There is a house on a stone foundation. This is what everyone is looking at right now.

13
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:34,810
I wonder if the appearance is black even in dark oak.

14
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:49,805
Was it written like summer color? 8.

15
00:03:49,805 --> 00:04:04,771
Spot restaurant.

16
00:04:04,771 --> 00:04:19,703
dream.

17
00:04:19,703 --> 00:04:34,764
I want to make the appearance black. Let's make a sound.

18
00:04:34,764 --> 00:04:49,762
4 is fine. But a little again. Alone after eating rice. Now in the 9th row.

19
00:04:49,762 --> 00:05:04,769
But maybe I'm a little.

20
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:19,817
12345 would be 5 here. 9.

21
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:34,821
Torikai 2nd term. I was focused.

22
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:49,692
love.

23
00:05:49,692 --> 00:06:04,694
No different no

24
00:06:04,694 --> 00:06:19,750
It's all over the place outside. I see.

25
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:34,762
I don't know what this is. In addition.

26
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:49,827
Does this look like it? Then I don't have any money. Probably the worst thing.

27
00:06:49,827 --> 00:07:04,742
I swore that I wouldn't sell it anymore.

28
00:07:04,742 --> 00:07:19,757
Why fall

29
00:07:19,757 --> 00:07:34,797
It's interesting to see the shape as you make it. How to make the past is also quite good.

30
00:07:34,797 --> 00:07:49,773
I can't ride anymore. If I want to block it, I won't fall anymore because I'll never have a house.

31
00:07:49,773 --> 00:08:04,688
It 's good, it 's good.

32
00:08:04,688 --> 00:08:19,785
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey.

33
00:08:19,785 --> 00:08:34,755
I can't stop. I can't really stop.

34
00:08:34,755 --> 00:08:49,828
I wonder what it would be like to send it and make an outer ring from oak logs of the city all over the place.

35
00:08:49,828 --> 00:09:19,795
A big adventure. Pororo.

36
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:34,783
What? Don't look like an old house. I'll buy a diaper.

37
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:49,770
A cool toy.

38
00:09:49,770 --> 00:10:04,804
It was a log that was really made. If you don't close it, it will fall here.

39
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:34,771
Pillar. Poi.

40
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:49,699
Birch. Not here.

00:10:49,699 --> 00:11:04,764
Iron.

42
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:19,772
It's United Nations wool. Like Peco.

43
00:11:19,772 --> 00:11:34,705
here.

44
00:11:34,705 --> 00:11:49,765
It's like a pool soul I'm coming to see a movie. I'm not.

45
00:11:49,765 --> 00:12:04,772
1000 of dark oak.

46
00:12:04,772 --> 00:12:19,727
This is OK.

47
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:34,765
The enemy is Kisoji. But I haven't been told yet. I get a torch.

48
00:12:34,765 --> 00:13:04,773
Ender dragon.

49
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:19,766
No no. I'm waiting with a mini timer.

50
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:49,780
From the country of India. Not here. Times Customer Factory.

51
00:13:49,780 --> 00:14:04,731

00:14:59,585 --> 00:15:14,533
I don't like tea.

56
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:29,522

63
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:14,564
It's nice. I wonder if I should go like this.

64
00:17:14,564 --> 00:17:29,571
It seems that Fue-san appeared on me when he tried to fix the endra bug. What does that mean?

65
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:44,584
What's happening over there. Let's do it together.

Tsukkomi with a stretched body.

71
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:14,548
I'm building by myself. If this also gets higher, I think it's too bad. It's an indication that an idiot is up and there is an endra.

72
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:29,574
Ochimachi Comet.

73
00:19:29,574 --> 00:19:44,564
