Because it's my husband 8.

338
01:55:39,604 --> 01:55:54,533
OK.

339
01:55:54,533 --> 01:56:09,608
Do you like your wife? My heart almost stopped. Come back to life Come back to life.

340
01:56:09,608 --> 01:56:24,621
Mr. Jeremiah Godwald This is my first look. I always watch only Avex videos.

341
01:56:24,621 --> 01:56:39,617
You're watching Avex, which is too bad. Not really.

342
01:56:39,617 --> 01:56:54,517
Is that ok. Thank you.

343
01:56:54,517 --> 01:57:09,606
I can't do X because I can't run that too heavy game. Here are two songs. I happened to come here.

344
01:57:09,606 --> 01:57:24,568
In my sister setting. The game falls in the middle of playing.

345
01:57:24,568 --> 01:57:54,606
The resolution is also lowered. I'll do it on a slightly small screen, but still.

346
01:57:54,606 --> 01:58:09,566
Gravo seems to be broken, but I wonder if that is suspicious. It seems that the size of the computer will be larger. The size of the computer is red under the desk.

347
01:58:09,566 --> 01:58:24,596
I wondered if a good one would come. I wonder how to bring it to my room.

348
01:58:24,596 --> 01:58:39,591
The memory of awesome gloss is so great that SSD. The woman is 10 or 20 or higher.

349
01:58:39,591 --> 01:59:09,605
It's 2 or 30 or 1.

350
01:59:09,605 --> 01:59:24,592
It's amazing. Now, what's that steam?

351
01:59:24,592 --> 01:59:39,573
External 7. I have a game on my external hard disk so I don't have it. You can put it in.

352
01:59:39,573 --> 01:59:54,605
I wonder if there is a wasteful place.

353
00:00:00,000 --> 02:00:11,731
You got a go-ahead, thank you.

354
02:00:11,731 --> 02:00:26,756
It's also safe. Thank you, Mr. Maeda, thank you.

355

Thank you. Ebara flower forehead.

356
02:00:41,723 --> 02:00:56,739
After this, why don't you come while doing various submissions? Take time to look while sniffing and go to bed early at night.

357
02:00:56,739 --> 02:01:11,720
If you look at the estimate even if you separate MSD and game SSD.

358
02:01:11,720 --> 02:01:26,751
So it's not different. Intel SSD. It felt like the SSD I stepped into was inside.

359
02:01:26,751 --> 02:01:41,723
He gave us a body, he's a hot mom.

360
02:01:41,723 --> 02:01:56,722
What do you do with the Grand Mother? Lead. How to put all the games on the D drive.

361
02:01:56,722 --> 02:02:11,736
Leave it all to me.

362
02:02:11,736 --> 02:02:26,787
Thank you Edoya Thank you Sumita Thank you Aki Thank you for the stamp. I don't want a drawing song.

Mikasa. Come on for delivery.

364
02:02:41,743 --> 02:02:56,775
I wonder what it was. It's a title like berry berry pancake, but it's original.

365
02:02:56,775 --> 02:03:26,786
There's a card in it, this is it, how do you get it?

366
02:03:26,786 --> 02:03:41,750
You should make it a moderator.

367
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:56,732
Why wasn't it the text? 8.

368
02:03:56,732 --> 02:04:11,749

It's an approaching punch.

375
02:06:11,729 --> 02:06:26,758
I'm sorry I used violence for no reason. I'd like to say thank you for this.

376
02:06:26,758 --> 02:06:41,758
In addition, the unemployed person is finally arranged.

379
02:07:11,763 --> 02:07:41,796
I can read it for a moment, but it's been three years and I can't stop writing buttons in Russian.

380
02:07:41,796 --> 02:07:56,732
I didn't write it with a button today. Hey, I don't know what you're saying, but I can tell that the way you speak is polite.

381
