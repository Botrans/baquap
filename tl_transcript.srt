1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:15,159
It'll be a little sloppy. Ah, I see, thank you for your kindness.

2
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:30,113
There are no cracked stairs, but as expected. It doesn't work as a staircase. It's kind of cracked, isn't it?

3
00:01:30,113 --> 00:01:45,077
But stairs. Born.

4
00:01:45,077 --> 00:02:00,136
I'm dying. There is something. I wonder if I was doing a delicious little bit of suguki.

5
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:15,152
It's still burning. I can only make Nene potatoes.

6
00:02:15,152 --> 00:02:30,193
I don't care because the one here wasn't working. I made it horny, but finally. A lot of glass workshops have been completed.

7
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:45,313
I came to the emerald gold pot. In particular. Every day, wondering if it's something I'm using now.

8
00:02:45,313 --> 00:03:00,165
You can do it later, you see, the experience value is over 30, so you can draw the gacha again. I put the fuel in the hopper.

9
00:03:00,165 --> 00:03:15,290
Even so, I wonder if there is a margin after that. I wondered what my hands were doing now. It 's my credit. It 's about time I went there.

10
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:30,316
Even though it was a magma bucket, I was trying to take credit for it. I'm sorry I don't really know. It was Sashisuseso sushi. It's a click.

11
00:03:30,316 --> 00:04:00,123
It's good.

12
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:15,203
After all, the sound of walking in the Nether brick feels good. It was even better. So I tried walking, but it was really good.

13
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:30,144
You're in trouble, you're in trouble. Bring one by one.

14
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:45,163
Sakagami: I'm wondering where to use it from terracotta. It's a great arrangement mission right now, so I'm stuck and add arrangements.

15
00:04:45,163 --> 00:05:00,161
Arrange name. You only need two of them. It's up to you to believe or not.

16
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:15,168
Holtax Zeian's egg carrier. Egg carrying test.

17
00:05:15,168 --> 00:05:30,144
Do I have to worry about this?

18
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:45,139
BOOKOFF I wonder if I'm making a castle. I understand what I mean. It was destroyed.

19
00:05:45,139 --> 00:06:00,087
An amateur who was killed. It's cracked.

20
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:15,125
I just wanted to create an atmosphere. Everything was cracked.

21
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:30,158
The world as if you saw an email is a peaceful life without conflict.

22
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:45,147
What kind of place is a bar in the first place? Polka I don't understand the feeling of polka even if I think about it.

23
00:06:45,147 --> 00:07:00,123
When will it be updated?

24
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:15,110
I'm not going to sleep. It's cute. Wait a minute.

25
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:30,122
This is a bad effect of asymmetry. It's not interesting to make it symmetric at home. Don't you think

26
00:07:30,122 --> 00:07:45,147
I just fell asleep.

27
00:07:45,147 --> 00:08:00,113
I do not understand. If it's too mossy.

28
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:15,116
Yes, thank you. Then already.

29
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:30,129
Ozone Leave your luggage open. I'll get here. I don't know if it's on hold.

30
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:45,116
No one can think of it. Recuperation Myon Myon Myon. It's straw.

31
00:08:45,116 --> 00:09:00,125
There is a movement in the foreground. I'm sorry I don't understand.

32
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:15,145
9 OK.

33
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:30,079
Awanavia Pop Star You. I'll make you crazy somehow.

34
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:45,165
Save. Then here. Why do you want to arrange so much that you can't cook?

35
00:09:45,165 --> 00:10:00,136
Do people who can't do Micra want to arrange?

36
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:15,141
There was no reason to change the name.

37
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:30,120
12345.

38
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:45,149
Rather than that, with the woman who arranged that person. It's strange.

39
00:10:45,149 --> 00:11:45,159
taste. Two under the sky.

40
00:11:45,159 --> 00:12:00,117
I remember two things. Did you write it perfectly?

41
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:15,099
I realized that I wasn't ashamed of anything.

42
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:30,088
I think I cut it all. It was not enough.

43
00:12:30,088 --> 00:12:45,083
Above all, you lack faith. Worship Polka.

44
00:12:45,083 --> 00:13:00,114
I want to sleep, so good night to sleep. Also the taste is there.

45
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:15,120
Tomorrow rice is amazing air conditioner noodle dragon. Something commented earlier.

46
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:30,109
It's just reflected well. Kitatone from here.

47
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:45,126
I've cut my birthday, another lap. I can't really feel it.

48
00:13:45,126 --> 00:14:00,125
If you see the eve of the festival you want to have fun.

49
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:45,145
There is also Osomatsu. Money is so much.

50
00:14:45,145 --> 00:15:00,162
It doesn't feel a little dirty like the first place, so I will make it a wall using stone bricks. This time around the stairs with the second step from the next one, it's a little bit.

51
00:15:00,162 --> 00:15:15,133
I was told that the roof would be triangular.

52
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:30,093
I don't think there are many people who can make the roof triangular tomorrow. There was such a technique.

53
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:45,111
I will do it. I'm in trouble. I make it a triangle. Be told.

54
00:15:45,111 --> 00:16:00,108
Because it's too big, here and here twins. I think it's this book.

55
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:15,132
It's like this. So it's Maruishi with everyone.

56
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:30,209
It's like combining round stones and bricks, but I don't like polka round stones. I wonder if there is anything.

57
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:45,121
Look at you. Where is that?

58
00:16:45,121 --> 00:17:00,133
The drugstore is cool.

59
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:15,158
Nether bricks I don't have any nether bricks right now, so I thought the terracotta I picked up the other day would be nice. I wonder if anyone should have a handle.

60
00:17:15,158 --> 00:17:30,149
There is a water elevator pattern next to Furano.

61
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:45,157
I thought there were many. Brown terracotta floor instead of alto.

62
00:17:45,157 --> 00:18:00,198
It seems to match the pink color. I'll try various things like terracotta. I feel more.

63
00:18:00,198 --> 00:18:15,166
Amazing temple color is a little. I feel like it's coming in from blue. Ordinary stones.

64
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:30,182
Iones However, it's normal in Japan.

65
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:45,150
It's not. Protect with something Maruishi You're using that 51 block.

66
00:18:45,150 --> 00:19:00,165
I'm making a block of sauce, so I'm a little worried about Portomonet.

67
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:15,100
I don't know because I've never been to a bar. Because have you ever been to a customer's bar?

68
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:45,489
You're young, right? Round stone bricks I'm sorry for making something like round stone bricks, because I haven't shared the recipe with them. I don't have one. Everything is a challenge challenge.

69
00:19:45,489 --> 00:20:00,287
By what I said. Ah, I've already gone.

70
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:30,423
One more, a little more, for the time being, those who made it according to this recipe. Well, first of all.

71
00:20:30,423 --> 00:20:45,275
I wondered if I brought my grandpa. Brown terracotta.

72
00:20:45,275 --> 00:21:00,133
It seems that modern art has popped out.

73
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:15,119
Suddenly, modern art has come to an end. Chocolate This is Yoshimi Maybe.

74
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:30,122
That shouldn't be the case.

75
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:45,220
Brand of tea. No.

76
00:21:45,220 --> 00:22:00,245
If you don't have the recipe ordered, you'll be in trouble. You're still in Korea. Anything for the time being.

77
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:15,140
Somehow I lean forward.

78
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:30,126
I know what it says and what it says. It's not there today.

79
00:22:30,126 --> 00:22:45,165
It's often different.

80
00:22:45,165 --> 00:23:00,194
It's amazing, I feel like I'm making them all look red.

81
00:23:00,194 --> 00:23:15,120
I'm worried. It's suitable for people who can see it with their own eyes.

82
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:30,235
Ah, this may not be the best. Is it different? Kyosho This is a little. You have a face. I've been here all the time.

83
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:45,128
I wonder why I can do it silently if I don't speak, but as soon as I talk, I become stupid, so I'm already talking. I'm grateful that there are people.

84
00:23:45,128 --> 00:24:00,107
What do you say, I have no hair again. Ma-chan.

85
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:15,292
Lost in feelings. It's better to have a pattern on it. Here is a reporter's sound like modern art.

86
00:24:15,292 --> 00:24:30,239
I want to leave the phone here if it's not here.

87
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:45,135
Yogurt Blockstone Brick would be made here. It's gone, right outside. It seems to disappear.

88
00:24:45,135 --> 00:25:00,177
I'll love you. You shouldn't overdo it. I'm planning to get a call from Otsu, Kumamoto City.

89
00:25:00,177 --> 00:25:15,114
That's about it.

90
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:30,107
Polished block Stollen Municipalities that do not handle. Use Palletus Black strike.

91
00:25:30,107 --> 00:25:45,143
There is also ah. Isn't this? I'm strong.

92
00:25:45,143 --> 00:26:00,103
This on Wednesday. I'm close to Kotta & not.

93
00:26:00,103 --> 00:26:15,100
I don't hate it. Ointment with a dolly. After all.

94
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:30,108
Please let me know how tired the ham block. After all it is a staircase. Is it possible to make stairs with blackstone bricks?

95
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:45,140
Are you listening?

96
00:26:45,140 --> 00:27:15,103
Detroit Police Department. Then. Well then.

97
00:27:15,103 --> 00:27:30,132
I don't know, but I don't know. Detroit Police Department.

98
00:27:30,132 --> 00:27:45,144
Is it here because it is from the highest place first?

99
00:27:45,144 --> 00:28:00,131
With a rice scoop. Because no one can imagine. I can't imagine it with Volka.

100
00:28:00,131 --> 00:28:15,112
Maybe I will use the stairs for the first time. How can I see the cloud gap?

101
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:30,091
You don't have this.

102
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:45,138
It's the first time to use Toyoko and Toyoko stairs.

103
00:28:45,138 --> 00:29:00,141
It's the real opposite.

104
00:29:00,141 --> 00:29:15,130
Cocoon Effective for height.

105
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:30,079
I'm getting closer. But that kind of thing will change.

106
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:45,130
No one knows No one knows.

107
00:29:45,130 --> 00:30:00,151
It's a little crazy. Oiden Festival.

108
00:30:00,151 --> 00:30:15,078
I've reached that area now.

109
00:30:15,078 --> 00:30:30,108
You don't have to do it here.

110
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:45,069
The difficulty level of this is the highest.

111
00:30:45,069 --> 00:31:00,165
The difficulty of this. I was aware of Ueda.

112
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:15,096
Learn. Sesshomaru Torisuke.

113
00:31:15,096 --> 00:31:30,119
Certainly something is too urgent. To arrange.

114
00:31:30,119 --> 00:32:15,184
Please arrange after going as planned.

115
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:45,106
There is a theory that is not bad.

116
00:32:45,106 --> 00:33:00,162
There is a theory that it is not the fault from Utoro. I think there is at all. I feel that this is not complete.

117
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:15,151
Rice police. Make a half block. Without skipping Super Chat.

118
00:33:15,151 --> 00:33:30,114
Please have it.

119
00:33:30,114 --> 00:33:45,124
It's too mid-slope.

120
00:33:45,124 --> 00:34:30,085
Because it pops out.

121
00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:45,187
It's not like this, so I want to read it aloud. Japanese Roronoa Zoro.

122
00:34:45,187 --> 00:35:00,134
I'm going to scrape the assembled blocks one by one with my voice. Even though I worked hard for each woman, I scraped it. Rope play and moon.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,132
Picture frame.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:45,088
free. A feeling of mellowness.

3
00:00:45,088 --> 00:01:00,087
Tourmaline. You use a mysterious thing. It's not different colors.

4
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:15,112
Namiha. Everyone is talking about things like alcohol characters lately. amazing.

5
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:30,113
Alcohol 2. Pride pride. What should I say?

6
00:01:30,113 --> 00:01:45,137
I really like alcohol. That's why I hate bending.

7
00:01:45,137 --> 00:02:00,116
I wonder what it is.

8
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:15,105
It's a little difficult though.

9
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:30,121
I don't want to do that book. It would be what.

10
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:45,144
It's best not to bother people who like alcohol. Put on purple.

11
00:02:45,144 --> 00:03:00,115
Big really. Say you don't want to bother people who really like alcohol.

12
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:15,128
There is something else.

13
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:30,066
I did not know.

14
00:03:30,066 --> 00:04:15,260
It's not like that. After that.

15
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:30,297
It's a bookshelf or something like that. It's like having a drink and having an effect. Hohohohohoho.

16
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:45,326
It doubles as a warehouse. The original one is probably. Count as a song lover.

17
00:04:45,326 --> 00:05:00,105
It's actually the year of the sky.

18
00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:15,101
So that's it. Depression-only menu.

19
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:30,239
Make it with big fish. This is nice.

20
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:45,228
With a piston. Do you make it?

21
00:05:45,228 --> 00:06:00,253
That's right, borrow menus and other ideas from various places.

22
00:06:00,253 --> 00:06:30,261
Thank you for your hard work.

23
00:06:30,261 --> 00:07:00,106
Yes. No, is there only the scenery left? Well, the scenery is fine.

24
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:15,153
You can like it, though.

25
00:07:15,153 --> 00:07:30,127
It was an Odaiba rope.

26
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:45,111
But I just want to make it lively. Don't wonder if you like nature. Don't think that you can hide it even though you've used a lot of my moss.

27
00:07:45,111 --> 00:08:00,176
Daiso is cool. I'm looking forward to doing something with my house in 3 from now on.

28
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:15,126
Berkant song suitable. Audience seats Eastern Europe.

29
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:30,100
Make it properly. A kanji that says it's a lively bar. Remind me.

30
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:45,162
Don't forget that we will make a Blanc chimney.

31
00:08:45,162 --> 00:09:00,139
I wonder what happened to this floor or something.

32
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:15,112
A bag with the smell of sake.

33
00:09:15,112 --> 00:09:30,101
Flooring is a persimmon.

34
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:45,122
Various traumas have come out. This is nice. I was particular about dark colors, but this is also the case.

35
00:09:45,122 --> 00:10:15,125
Ramune in terracotta. What color was there? I talked with you.

36
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:30,076
I wonder if you can see this world too.

37
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:45,126
How are you feeling? Darts billiards Iida. Thank you.

38
00:10:45,126 --> 00:11:15,107
Why do you cook for your sister? reddit mimimi Selflessness. Will you be born?

39
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:30,146
I have the best juice right now.

40
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:45,120
It's true that there is a second floor. Where is it. The colored one.

41
00:11:45,120 --> 00:12:00,131
Redstone lamp.

42
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:15,134
Terracotta This does not come out unless it is baked.

43
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:30,132
It shines. If you make an effort, it's for kids and it's really cute underneath.

44
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:45,125
You don't have to let the mutsu shine, so you didn't say that you're going to make a shining signboard next time. Make it like an aunt.

45
00:12:45,125 --> 00:13:00,138
For the time being, I tried to make various terracotta colors. I forgot.

46
00:13:00,138 --> 00:14:15,070
I want to make this.

47
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:30,144
I wonder if I can put it under this. I want to try anything.

48
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:45,067
be able to.

49
00:14:45,067 --> 00:15:00,091
I have nothing to do.

50
00:15:00,091 --> 00:15:15,132
It's finally time for the redstones I've saved with Seco Seco to play an active role. Until now, I've only used it to make the dragon's head shine.

51
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:30,159
I want to use it, but I couldn't use it because I would definitely be a friend. I want to bring rice, but it's not like that. This is probably it. Don't shine now.

52
00:15:30,159 --> 00:16:00,090
Talk and don't talk. Doesn't spell.

53
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:30,080
It seems warm.

54
00:16:30,080 --> 00:17:45,134
I'm sorry I'm sorry. The reaction of girls at such times is really annoying.

55
00:17:45,134 --> 00:18:00,096
I'm no longer a gust, I'm not a Saizeriya, just a gas.

56
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:15,133
Sorry for the misunderstanding. Who is this guy out there anymore?

57
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:30,099
You see, it's not a steakhouse anymore. You really reacted normally.

58
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:45,157
Well done, it's a bar. I made a polka circus, but it turned into a bar. What should I do?

59
00:18:45,157 --> 00:19:00,146
It's not a surprise donkey, but it comes with a huge menu.

60
00:19:00,146 --> 00:19:15,159
It 's okay, it 's shining all the time, is n't it? I'm happy. Is the signboard here?

61
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:30,132
What do you say? Is there?

62
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:45,118
Kuroda Yoneda Fork happened in the distance.

63
00:19:45,118 --> 00:20:15,198
What a name.

64
00:20:15,198 --> 00:20:30,133
It's not as good as a Rummy worker.

65
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:45,171
Please come and see me.

66
00:20:45,171 --> 00:21:00,122
I wonder if that normal polka bar is fine. I always think I can't separate one line.

67
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:30,106
I can't. Wait a minute, Polka. What do you call a fish?

68
00:21:30,106 --> 00:22:15,093
Barbar Barbar.

69
00:22:15,093 --> 00:22:30,160
Hanyu Baru. It's a bar. It's spring, though.

70
00:22:30,160 --> 00:23:00,123
Beer Garden Beer Garden Polka.

71
00:23:00,123 --> 00:23:30,122
There is no garden.

72
00:23:30,122 --> 00:24:00,096
Luida's bar or something like that.

73
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:15,112
It feels like this popular izakaya with Nami.

74
00:24:15,112 --> 00:24:45,170
This is still fashionable.

75
00:24:45,170 --> 00:25:00,140
There was a person who was building with this as it is.

76
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:15,124
After all it is fun to understand. Do you know what it is? This is also uselessly cool. It's not in vain though.

77
00:25:15,124 --> 00:25:30,156
Hey, I want to see where it shines when it gets a little dark. I just want to see the song where it's in.

78
00:25:30,156 --> 00:25:45,148
Prepare it and use it as it is transmitted to it. I thought it was only 5. You're going here too.

79
00:25:45,148 --> 00:26:00,106
is that so. You're going over here too.

80
00:26:00,106 --> 00:26:15,151
Well there is at all.

81
00:26:15,151 --> 00:26:30,175
From now on, the side, back, and chimneys haven't grown. I'm really looking forward to it.

82
00:26:30,175 --> 00:26:45,167
Also this time it's not this circuit of RED STONE, but I've learned so much that I really like this one. It was so cute. It's also in the land.

83
00:26:45,167 --> 00:27:00,138
What is this this pattern? I wonder if I can make a cute girl using this.

84
00:27:00,138 --> 00:27:15,128
I wonder if it will come out if I check something like the chandelier I used. Can you do it?

85
00:27:15,128 --> 00:27:30,100
I made a crushed costume, but I feel lonely. I got a mushroom egg book.

86
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:45,151
Be cheating. The side of the castle was also put in here. The ceiling is low.

87
00:27:45,151 --> 00:28:00,105
It's okay, maybe this is secret. Darts or darts. What happened? Darts. darts. Billiards.

88
00:28:00,105 --> 00:28:15,148
What's more? 8.

89
00:28:15,148 --> 00:28:30,133
I said Music Box.

90
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:45,106
I wonder if I can make it. I plan to make a big barrel.

91
00:28:45,106 --> 00:29:15,126
Isn't it a guild after all? It just becomes a polka dream. Daddy who puts up the quest. I can't stop saying that it's going to be a mess.

92
00:29:15,126 --> 00:29:30,119
Koko-chan. Could it be used as a guild?

93
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:45,146
In the first place, it is also used as a guild and a bar. Lux Quest Mama Hey.

94
00:29:45,146 --> 00:30:00,188
If you see this. Even if I stayed here, it's already here.

95
00:30:00,188 --> 00:30:15,156
You should have it Shadow MOD. I was killed.

96
00:30:15,156 --> 00:30:30,153
This is a mass of sense that was killed. I'm too smart.

97
00:30:30,153 --> 00:30:45,095
It's light. Like shit.

98
00:30:45,095 --> 00:31:00,142
If so, can you see the light in the middle? The place of the light seen from the window glass or a little around here, maybe. The feeling of being told is really the best.

99
00:31:00,142 --> 00:31:15,150
Well then, I'm satisfied, so I'll do my best to collaborate with the chairman. I'm super happy to have gone.

100
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:30,109
It's really night. Thank you. I won't sleep, I'll meet soon.

101
00:31:30,109 --> 00:31:45,148
Satisfaction is amazing When did you start thank you, this will change. Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow.
