I'm a construction worker. I'm cleaning. Don't worry.

166
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:15,119
Next, let's get to know this and give it to the tonsils.

167
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:45,126

But it's not a game. It's not annihilated. can not do.

175
00:06:15,112 --> 00:06:30,090
I think it's good.

176
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:45,146
Another one. It's amazing, where and where it's annihilated.

177
00:06:45,146 --> 00:07:15,087
I'm being beaten. This is easier to do. I'm waiting.

178
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:30,163
I'm telling you to clear the road.

The plane was much easier. I understand that it's red. Yes, it's red now. No different no

186
00:09:15,112 --> 00:09:45,126
It has hardened from here to here.

199
00:12:45,126 --> 00:13:00,137
I took the tampon twice yesterday, which is amazing. Pull all the bikes.

200

Climb up.

203
00:13:45,185 --> 00:14:00,122
I ran away from the obstacles.

204
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:15,112

00:10:15,145 --> 00:11:00,108
I bought something.

231
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:15,148
Even though the bag is completely closed, give it a try. This pose.

232
00:11:15,148 --> 00:11:30,117
