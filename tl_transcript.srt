00:00:00,000 --> 00:22:24,393
It doesn't start.

2
00:22:24,393 --> 00:22:39,370
To all 200% of dads. It started before the bikeman started.

3
00:22:39,370 --> 00:23:09,375
I didn't decide to discontinue today either.

4
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:24,431
That's why I'm going to do Splatoon 2 together this time.

00:23:39,412 --> 00:23:54,366
Are you there Quibo battle.

7
00:23:54,366 --> 00:24:09,421
Well, it's a secondary weapon using only Splatoon, isn't it? It was a match against embarrassment, isn't it?

8
00:24:09,421 --> 00:24:24,426
I would like to judge. Stay without meals.

9
00:24:24,426 --> 00:24:39,406
Everyone loves it. I think it's tonjiru, but it's for 4 this time.

10
00:24:39,406 --> 00:24:54,366
I'm thinking of disposing of finding someone who is hiding. Yes.

11
00:24:54,366 --> 00:25:09,369
Can I call you love?

12
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:24,385
What a Splatoon today. Shirasu kilograms.

13
00:25:24,385 --> 00:25:54,363
There is nothing in particular on the indoor tub bath side. Today's choice.

14
00:25:54,363 --> 00:26:09,412
The child cuts it.

15
00:26:09,412 --> 00:26:24,375
It's kind of like that. Just a little 5. Who is Dorami-chan?

16
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:39,418
It's a new Subaru car.

17
00:26:39,418 --> 00:26:54,390
Dora. I'm not good at it.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:27:11,387
I wonder if I can come in if I come out as a friend. That plabe pass is right now.

19
00:27:11,387 --> 00:27:26,326
Seriously, I was doing it behind the scenes.

20
00:27:26,326 --> 00:27:41,324
Did you do it to the last minute? See you. I was a mother. Mom.

21
00:27:41,324 --> 00:27:56,306
Was mom a dad? Rice, please.

22
00:27:56,306 --> 00:28:11,314
I wonder if this is a little hidden. I would like to connect with you by talking.

23
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:41,328
Can't you?

24
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:56,313
I want you to choose so much. Satellite World, please.

25
00:28:56,313 --> 00:29:11,286
Don't let everyone fly A really dangerous image.

26
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:26,321
Not because.

27
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:41,233
Good evening.

28
00:29:41,233 --> 00:29:56,294
It's an experience that you can't easily experience.

29
00:29:56,294 --> 00:30:11,336
I'm aiming for rockfish, so I'd be happy if you could invite me.

00:32:56,345 --> 00:33:11,316
When hiding. Because it depends, everyone.

44
00:34:26,318 --> 00:34:41,285
It's cold first. Please leave it as it is.

45
00:34:41,285 --> 00:34:56,303
Peach blossoms because they hide. Because Mutsugoro.

46
00:34:56,303 --> 00:35:11,325

47
00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:41,290
I wonder if it should be wider. Hayato coloring.

48
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:56,237
That's right.

49
00:35:56,237 --> 00:36:11,303
I don't know how it was from the absolute or that kind of crazy 102.

50
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:26,333
It will be 5 seconds left. This is bad.

51
00:36:26,333 --> 00:37:41,301
Good or good. There are no signs of people at all.

52
00:37:41,301 --> 00:38:26,303
I'm not lonely at all.

53
00:38:26,303 --> 00:39:11,305
Can't you climb if you didn't know at all?

54
00:39:11,305 --> 00:39:41,317
Why are you left at the last minute? Let's know this, to be honest.

55

Let's ask Sophie too.

59
00:40:41,278 --> 00:40:56,310
Is it a healing system? I wonder what about.

60
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:11,355

It's okay, though. fish.

62
00:41:26,306 --> 00:41:41,261

And it's 4 o'clock because it's the version that the OK bath can find.

67
00:42:43,268 --> 00:42:58,207
This is like this.

68
00:42:58,207 --> 00:43:43,275
A little games. Can you find it? Matsune for 1 minute, look back.

69
00:43:43,275 --> 00:43:58,259
You're the opposite, Papaheim Look.

70
00:43:58,259 --> 00:44:13,250
Is that so? If this is the case.

71
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:28,285
Like Takasaki.

72
00:44:28,285 --> 00:44:43,245
how was it. It feels painful.

73
00:44:43,245 --> 00:45:13,254
At times like this, I'm not around here, but in my bag.

74
00:45:13,254 --> 00:45:28,285
I was there.

75
00:45:28,285 --> 00:45:43,269
Don't ride in Meguro. That's right here.

76
00:45:43,269 --> 00:46:28,226

77
00:46:28,226 --> 00:46:43,188
Nitori.

78
00:46:43,188 --> 00:46:58,247
Mio-chan I did it a while ago, so maybe I'm alone.

79
00:46:58,247 --> 00:47:13,237
Feel good.

80
00:47:13,237 --> 00:47:28,284
I'm to finish it.

81
00:47:28,284 --> 00:48:13,193

That's right. Oh yeah yeah yeah.

87
00:49:43,202 --> 00:50:58,283
I put out too much about what I was doing.

88
00:50:58,283 --> 00:51:13,257
Maru-chan is a little more difficult as society's expectations increase.

89
00:51:13,257 --> 00:51:28,280
It was a bit like a bonito.

90
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:43,255
Even in English, Sit-chan is Ramen Icchan. It certainly doesn't make sense to imitate your seniors.

91
00:51:43,255 --> 00:52:13,263
The ghost senior, please let me know about your house. Maybe it's a little stronger than before. Let's make it 9 minutes now.

92
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:28,259
It becomes mellow.

93
00:52:28,259 --> 00:52:43,221
I wish we could hide.

94
00:52:43,221 --> 00:52:58,242
If you say no, no, no.

95
00:52:58,242 --> 00:53:13,253
I thought it was too pachinko, so I was forcing it. But what about this? I think everyone will apply it based on what they sell.

96
00:53:13,253 --> 00:53:28,226
How do you say that?

97
00:53:28,226 --> 00:53:58,232

00:55:28,229 --> 00:55:43,303
In front of Isatomae. What is your password?

102
00:55:43,303 --> 00:55:58,275

105
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:58,230
I laughed.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:57:15,128
Welcome back.

107
00:57:15,128 --> 00:57:45,167
I lost.

108
00:57:45,167 --> 00:58:00,181
Can I go now?

109
00:58:00,181 --> 00:58:15,215
Squid beans. I was attacking the last minute. I've eaten it.

110
00:58:15,215 --> 00:58:30,223

111
00:58:30,223 --> 00:58:45,216
Yes what?

112
00:58:45,216 --> 00:59:00,194
No problem. Because it's strong.

113
00:59:00,194 --> 00:59:15,202
Morimoto. Do you want to start breaking up?

114
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:30,225
I know something.

115
00:59:30,225 --> 00:59:45,223
I thought I was saying something. It's anchovy.

116
00:59:45,223 --> 01:00:00,192
I `ll stick it. This is the area of ​​3 above.

117
01:00:00,192 --> 01:00:30,210
I'll paint around Mr. Kono so that he can run easily.

118
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:45,198
Yeah. But you can come back soon.

119
01:00:45,198 --> 01:01:00,244
I think Mr. Kamio will make it for me. Tempura-san heaven. How old.

120
01:01:00,244 --> 01:01:15,202
Please do not pass. You can kill the enemy for 2 turns, so take a picture of Koro-san cutting it.

121
01:01:15,202 --> 01:01:30,258
A road that feels like sewing around or painting Nakagawa. Because Rafter had it. What's the last thing I did in the weather?

122
01:01:30,258 --> 01:01:45,175
Even from a small charger.

Wilderness collaboration Splatoon shooter collaboration. Someone asks me which one to put the needle in.

124
01:02:00,201 --> 01:02:15,280
I've never bought it. It looks like I'm going to eat, though I've never met him.

125
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:30,226
It might be a hit. A chance to go.

126
01:02:30,226 --> 01:02:45,190
Me too. Then I don't have it.

Rascal is helpful because it's easy to pull when you think it's dangerous to apply it to your wife.

I was hitting with aqua poorly.

150
01:11:15,209 --> 01:11:30,232
Things that you can understand. Only professionals can mess with each other. It was on the same level as me.

151
01:11:30,232 --> 01:11:45,200
So that's it. I have to get used to it.

152
01:11:45,200 --> 01:12:00,235
I've been conscious of emoticons lately. Not entirely yet.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 01:12:17,247
