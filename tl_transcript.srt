Ten. This is one.

168
02:09:24,918 --> 02:09:39,905

169
02:09:39,905 --> 02:09:54,921
Mining. 11.

170
02:09:54,921 --> 02:10:09,964
Harvest is good. It can be anywhere. Everyone is full of harvesting talent.

171
02:10:09,964 --> 02:10:24,865

172
02:10:24,865 --> 02:10:39,934

2.

174
02:10:54,859 --> 02:11:09,944
What's more than that?

175
02:11:09,944 --> 02:11:24,938
I would like to fix it. It's a priority.

176
02:11:24,938 --> 02:11:39,977
What are you going to do in this case? No one else is good at it. What a fire. Where.

The ceiling is breaking. It's just right.

179
02:12:24,905 --> 02:12:39,946
Did you get frustrated when you entered the room while you were sleeping? Let's make it by the ability.

180
02:12:39,946 --> 02:12:54,932
Chat that doesn't look strong. Gradius. Should I lie?

181
02:12:54,932 --> 02:13:09,950
Shield belt. One-handed matter.

Make a weapon Make a Gladius.

183
02:13:24,953 --> 02:13:39,917
How many people are there? Emergency food. I wonder if there is no edge or it is an edge.

184
02:13:39,917 --> 02:13:54,855
Strawberry.

185
02:13:54,855 --> 02:14:09,982
I wonder if there is nowhere. A little more abnormal. This is different.

186
02:14:09,982 --> 02:14:24,918
This is it once every time.

187
02:14:24,918 --> 02:14:39,928
It's true. Even if you really put it out, you can do it. Didn't I have any friends?

188
02:14:39,928 --> 02:15:09,938

192
02:15:54,931 --> 02:16:09,967
Then what do you have?

193
02:16:09,967 --> 02:16:24,909
That old man is that 56. But it's a plus.

194
02:16:24,909 --> 02:16:39,955
A new weapon.

195
02:16:39,955 --> 02:17:09,007
It's a hand, someone, another couple, chocolate, a couple in this cat game, Fumi-chan, listen to this game, a couple now.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 02:17:26,969

I can't fight. 0.

203
02:18:56,014 --> 02:19:11,009

50,000 defects. Running river 10 When the wrong person fights.

I wonder what to do. Found Anshin 12 Two people at a bread shop.

207

Easy emergency rations. Why can't I choose?

209
02:20:26,077 --> 02:20:41,024
I don't decide on my own. Leave it at 8 and above.

210
02:20:41,024 --> 02:20:56,041
Just in case an extra 8 is used, a little mandarin orange.

211
02:20:56,041 --> 02:21:11,009
Can I go? This is the way home. Take it to the kelp square. If you take me, I'll go up if I can find it.

215
02:21:56,021 --> 02:22:11,991

It's easy to take a little more when you go. Is it okay to have a margin of 1 minute?

221
02:23:41,061 --> 02:23:56,018
You can bring 10 of them. You have a bomb, you have a bomb.

222
