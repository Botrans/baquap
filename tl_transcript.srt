It's okay now.

3
01:43:15,847 --> 01:43:30,816
Hiro is YouTube Pooh. You feel something like that. The display is strange. I set it at 23:00.

4
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:45,843
Oops. If it's okay now, leave it as it is.

5
01:43:45,843 --> 01:44:00,858
I wonder if the sound is okay. Are you okay. With a kotatsu. I hit it again for about 10 minutes.

6
01:44:00,858 --> 01:44:15,849
I'm sloppy. OK OK Then do it. It 's delicious.

7
01:44:15,849 --> 01:44:30,851
I'm fine too. After waking up today.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 01:44:47,698
After that, I have to record it in a hurry. Submit it.

01:44:47,698 --> 01:45:02,713
Delicious rice. The neck. It hurts a little.

12
01:45:32,732 --> 01:45:47,702
The bed I'm using. I live in Fukushima.

13
01:45:47,702 --> 01:46:02,776
I would emphasize it.

01:46:02,776 --> 01:46:17,686

I misunderstood it as an ender pearl. Shobon.

23
01:48:32,710 --> 01:48:47,707
Blaze. Blaze rod. I don't have the powder.

24
01:48:47,707 --> 01:49:02,727
You can make it.

25
01:49:02,727 --> 01:49:17,736
I wonder if I couldn't get it.

26
01:49:17,736 --> 01:49:32,647
Collet.

27
01:49:32,647 --> 01:49:47,717
Was it obsidian? Ender.

28
01:49:47,717 --> 01:50:02,700

01:54:02,752 --> 01:54:32,713
I donated it to the school.

45
01:54:32,713 --> 01:54:47,708
I donated it to an elementary school.

46
01:54:47,708 --> 01:55:02,690
From the new model. After having rice bread.

47
01:55:02,690 --> 01:55:32,719
I wonder if the creeper is coming.

48
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:47,732
Because it's a perfect trauma.

49
01:55:47,732 --> 01:56:02,715

Good morning Thank you. I'll give it back to the end of the delivery today.

74
02:02:19,597 --> 02:02:34,635
I didn't think it would be crazy to have puffer fish poison for people like that.

75
02:02:34,635 --> 02:03:04,644
It's not docomo, Rena-chan. It's pretty soon. It's spreading.

76
02:03:04,644 --> 02:03:19,626
It's notorious. It's not bad that it's funny. It's not bad.

77
02:03:19,626 --> 02:03:34,619
Pocopoco Golden construction planned. I want to give it later.

78
02:03:34,619 --> 02:03:49,642

80
02:04:04,633 --> 02:04:19,607
Was it here? It was verbal. This one?

81
02:04:19,607 --> 02:04:34,654
That's why I thought I'd make it a stilt type.

82
02:04:34,654 --> 02:04:49,621
Ake? The matter that was here. Let's buy it. Oh no.

83
02:04:49,621 --> 02:05:04,638
I can hear you.

84
02:05:04,638 --> 02:05:19,627
I'm doing it. It looks thin. There is.

85
02:05:19,627 --> 02:05:34,652
It's okay to make it a stilt type. I wonder if I've grown up around here.

86
02:05:34,652 --> 02:05:49,639
While chatting. I can't make it in the air.

87
02:05:49,639 --> 02:06:04,636
I'm scared of the air.

88
02:06:04,636 --> 02:06:19,611
Was it like that here? I'm scared.

89
02:06:19,611 --> 02:06:34,606

91
02:07:04,600 --> 02:07:19,648
It's a longing to be numb.

It's annoying, what should I do? type a is saved.

96
02:08:49,629 --> 02:09:04,638
Certainly a little strange.

97
02:09:04,638 --> 02:09:19,604
I want to put some glass on it. If it.

98
02:09:19,604 --> 02:09:34,605
Glass building.

99
02:09:34,605 --> 02:09:49,546
Glass building.

100
02:09:49,546 --> 02:10:04,624
I wonder if it shouldn't be too expensive, like a fashionable stained glass.

101
02:10:04,624 --> 02:10:19,658
It's fashionable.

102
02:10:19,658 --> 02:10:34,650
Progress is progressing. I can do what I want to do. Not proceed.

103
02:10:34,650 --> 02:10:49,652
Cobra claw. I have a nose.

104
02:10:49,652 --> 02:11:04,639
There is evidence.

105
02:11:04,639 --> 02:11:19,637
The torch also has a nose.

106
02:11:19,637 --> 02:11:49,674
I'm surprised when it comes out of Chikako. What stone do you have?

107
02:11:49,674 --> 02:12:04,608
Ishimoto Monster. Ah, I came, yes, yes.

Bat meta color. A little noise countermeasure.

110
02:12:34,610 --> 02:12:49,635
I don't want you to speak out. The voice advances. What will happen to you?

111
02:12:49,635 --> 02:13:04,618
This is. OK for the time being.

112
02:13:04,618 --> 02:13:19,636
Let's put the lid on.

113
02:13:19,636 --> 02:13:34,695
Somewhat a little.

114
02:13:34,695 --> 02:13:49,562
Kuro-chan.

115
02:13:49,562 --> 02:14:04,618

Okay lyrics.

121
02:15:36,545 --> 02:15:51,565
Just digging the soil makes me laugh.

122
02:15:51,565 --> 02:16:21,583
Mr. Pakupaku looks happy.

123
02:16:21,583 --> 02:16:36,553
Crunchy crunchy.

124
02:16:36,553 --> 02:16:51,547
Really wonderful. Please. Thank you.

125
02:16:51,547 --> 02:17:06,537
Is the company okay?

126
02:17:06,537 --> 02:17:21,585
Welcome Mr. Hatsumi.

127
02:17:21,585 --> 02:17:36,541
I managed to get a good deal with the adhesive.

128
02:17:36,541 --> 02:17:51,579
It's not a croissant, it's not Kuro-chan. I love simple bread.

129
02:17:51,579 --> 02:18:06,535
I can't take that lie right now.

130
02:18:06,535 --> 02:18:21,507
Sazae. It's funny.

131
02:18:21,507 --> 02:18:36,525
I love strawberry milk.

132
02:18:36,525 --> 02:18:51,566
I'm not good at you, but I like strawberries and bananas. It's not because it's in the normal position.

133
02:18:51,566 --> 02:19:06,535
You can fly. You can't use coffee.

134
02:19:06,535 --> 02:19:21,538
I wonder what. Straight tea.

135
02:19:21,538 --> 02:19:36,520
I can see Kitasato. A little bit. When I went.

136
02:19:36,520 --> 02:19:51,555
The tea I'm drinking now. What's this.

137
02:19:51,555 --> 02:20:21,555
Well, that usual Hetalia-loving friend. Hetalia's favorite friend.

138
02:20:21,555 --> 02:20:36,553
I think foster parents mean.

139
02:20:36,553 --> 02:20:51,548
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

140
02:20:51,548 --> 02:21:06,522
Hetalia generation I thought it was very popular.

141
02:21:06,522 --> 02:21:21,561
8 or something.

142
02:21:21,561 --> 02:21:36,560
It's sweet but it was taken down.

143
02:21:36,560 --> 02:21:51,594
I don't know what it's like now. It seems that they are doing events.

144
02:21:51,594 --> 02:22:06,527
I wonder if this area hasn't come. I wonder if I wanted to eat zombies too.

145
02:22:06,527 --> 02:22:21,557
I talked without sleeping at night.

146
02:22:21,557 --> 02:22:36,557
Also, I'm hungry with equipment. That's a problem.

147
02:22:36,557 --> 02:22:51,523
It doesn't hurt now. Hoi Hoi.

148
02:22:51,523 --> 02:23:21,565
That's it here.

149
02:23:21,565 --> 02:23:36,555
It arrived. Delivery of this time is saved. I'm saved.

150
02:23:36,555 --> 02:23:51,563
What are earphones? I thought I'd do it today. There were a lot of meetings.

151
02:23:51,563 --> 02:24:06,578
I want to have a house. Bread.

152
02:24:06,578 --> 02:24:21,575
I did my best in the village of Kyoto.

153
02:24:21,575 --> 02:24:36,545
Like putting stones in it.

154
02:24:36,545 --> 02:24:51,565
I'm really looking forward to it.

155
02:24:51,565 --> 02:25:06,535
Hey hey hey hey. I can't help saying this year because there are so many things to look forward to.

156
02:25:06,535 --> 02:25:21,509
I can understand the feelings of the Lord from now on.

157
02:25:21,509 --> 02:25:36,563
Won't you say it after all?

158
02:25:36,563 --> 02:25:50,482

Very 15 minutes left. Disgaea.

The best software stock in Japan. Not yet. Everyone do it.

162
02:26:36,534 --> 02:26:51,526
That's the friend battle.

163
02:26:51,526 --> 02:27:06,533
That person. Toriko is waiting for you. Somehow.

164
02:27:06,533 --> 02:27:21,538
I want to stop it somehow. Toriko-chan.

165
02:27:21,538 --> 02:27:36,561
Make me sick. Tomato. Is it the last inning next?

166
02:27:36,561 --> 02:27:51,532
If you don't roll, next.

167
02:27:51,532 --> 02:28:06,577
Yaoi, I'm still sick of only two.

168
02:28:06,577 --> 02:28:21,529
By the time the content arrives.

169
02:28:21,529 --> 02:28:36,566

171
02:28:51,564 --> 02:29:06,500
It starts with P.

172
02:29:06,500 --> 02:29:21,550
Today's supper is a cigarette.

Tropical container.

174
02:29:52,422 --> 02:30:07,435
I happened to be.

175
02:30:07,435 --> 02:30:22,423
Somehow daddy is doing it. The waterfall lived.

176
02:30:22,423 --> 02:30:37,467
That's right, I haven't seen it yet.

177
02:30:37,467 --> 02:31:07,449
Motocross game. A difficult museum.

178
02:31:07,449 --> 02:31:22,491
I'm wondering who I am now. Even when the card is on. Is that roasted?

179
02:31:22,491 --> 02:31:37,458
I wonder if it's sunny.

180
02:31:37,458 --> 02:31:52,458
Is it a supermarket inside the wasp needle? Somehow somehow.

181
02:31:52,458 --> 02:32:07,435
Marimo was also beautiful. Open a little more. Special sale item.

182
02:32:07,435 --> 02:32:22,485
It's such a cheap sheep.

183
02:32:22,485 --> 02:32:53,504
I wouldn't have noticed if I was talking. I talk when I'm crazy.

184
02:32:53,504 --> 02:33:07,434
Mandarake. Florist.

185
02:33:07,434 --> 02:33:22,435
Only Sao.

186
02:33:22,435 --> 02:33:53,505
Good evening pole bamboo. If you can make this device, I want you to play with it.

187
02:33:53,505 --> 02:34:07,458
Whether you can win or not. Do you really keep losing? It's amazing.

188
02:34:07,458 --> 02:34:22,448
I didn't do it, but when I was three people. To put out so much.

189
02:34:22,448 --> 02:34:37,445
Still lose.

190
02:34:37,445 --> 02:34:53,506
There is no injustice that is not voice. This strange.

191
02:34:53,506 --> 02:35:07,497
If you don't go straight, you can enter the lower tier. I can not imitate.

192
02:35:07,497 --> 02:35:22,465
You're right.

193
02:35:22,465 --> 02:35:37,483
Really elite elite with such GACKT.

194
02:35:37,483 --> 02:35:52,481
I like how to speak even if the pronunciation other is not corrected. Thank you. The pronunciation is strange. After apologizing. I thought it would be hard to hear something.

195
02:35:52,481 --> 02:36:07,453
They give me rice. Quite quite.

196
02:36:07,453 --> 02:36:22,458
Oh yeah, I'm coming from here.

197
02:36:22,458 --> 02:36:37,382
does not change.

198
02:36:37,382 --> 02:36:52,453
It's unsafe, isn't it? I heard that you can get zombie equipment.

199
02:36:52,453 --> 02:37:07,484
Orix I feel like I've heard a zombie voice now.

200
02:37:07,484 --> 02:37:22,432
I haven't. Through the strongest equipment. But over there.

201
02:37:22,432 --> 02:37:37,414
that. I'm glad it wasn't over there.

202
02:37:37,414 --> 02:37:52,471
Yeah, The Light.

203
02:37:52,471 --> 02:38:22,451
I'll cry if the Nezalite is taken.

204
02:38:22,451 --> 02:38:52,437
I'll bring it to my hand. Collected here.

205
02:38:52,437 --> 02:39:07,452
Kazuha.

206
02:39:07,452 --> 02:39:22,460
Hatsumi-san, there are many today. Because it's default.

207
02:39:22,460 --> 02:39:37,420
This isn't it.

208
02:39:37,420 --> 02:39:52,466
I'm not going anywhere else, but thank you. Did anyone get it?

209
02:39:52,466 --> 02:40:07,441
Because it is a normal operation.

210
02:40:07,441 --> 02:40:22,493
If you start doing this. I'm curious about everything. I was in trouble.

211
02:40:22,493 --> 02:40:52,480
But do you care? I don't have one.

212
02:40:52,480 --> 02:41:07,421
I'm this one.

213
02:41:07,421 --> 02:41:22,436

214
02:41:22,436 --> 02:41:37,388
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday.

02:41:37,388 --> 02:41:53,542
And some people aren't on their birthday.

216
02:41:53,542 --> 02:42:07,470
Happy. Happy Day to You Happy.

217
02:42:07,470 --> 02:42:22,470
Every one. I wish you a happy day.

218
02:42:22,470 --> 02:42:37,433
I just wish everyone happiness. Congratulations to everyone.

219
02:42:37,433 --> 02:42:52,443
Cocoa village. It was a real birthday.

220
02:42:52,443 --> 02:43:07,440
Who is this Eva final episode.

221
02:43:07,440 --> 02:43:22,496
Congrats. Congratulations on your will.

222
02:43:22,496 --> 02:43:37,405
I'm a woman.

223
02:43:37,405 --> 02:43:52,467
It's a piano will. That's right.

224
02:43:52,467 --> 02:44:07,482
Say that too. I couldn't save anyone It seems like I couldn't save everyone.

225
02:44:07,482 --> 02:44:22,442
Shima-chan. Thank you Every One.

226
02:44:22,442 --> 02:44:37,451
It's not your birthday.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 02:44:54,382
Where do you like it?

228
02:44:54,382 --> 02:45:09,371
It was drawn. It's sloppy.

229
02:45:09,371 --> 02:45:24,353
I'm not happy with it because I can't see it at all. Anime.

230
02:45:24,353 --> 02:45:39,392
It will be buried.

231
02:45:39,392 --> 02:45:54,427
Kerorin.

232
02:45:54,427 --> 02:46:24,374
Do you want to have sex?

233
02:46:24,374 --> 02:46:39,305
Good night. Scales.

234
02:46:39,305 --> 02:46:54,409
The mayor was late. Now is your chance. It seems that you can see it for free, everyone.

235
02:46:54,409 --> 02:47:24,402
You're terrible, how many hours will it take? It seems that the mountain itself is not free.

236
02:47:24,402 --> 02:47:39,351
If this is included, it will arrive quickly.

237
02:47:39,351 --> 02:47:54,378
Well, it's 30 minutes each. What will happen?

238
02:47:54,378 --> 02:48:09,354
About Tiffany Japan. How much

239
02:48:09,354 --> 02:48:24,394
That's 12 hours.

240
02:48:24,394 --> 02:48:39,302
What a thing.

241
02:48:39,302 --> 02:48:54,306
Happy Birthday.

242
02:48:54,306 --> 02:49:09,366
I think it's good. I can't help but make a mistake.

243
02:49:09,366 --> 02:49:24,391
Do you want to reach this area? The flowers are in bloom.

244
02:49:24,391 --> 02:49:39,380
I was telling you now.
