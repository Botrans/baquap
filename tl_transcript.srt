1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,128
It's time, I hope you helped.

2
00:00:30,128 --> 00:00:45,120
It's terrible so far so far. Sometimes play.

3
00:00:45,120 --> 00:01:00,061
First of all, Hayato hits here.

4
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:15,125
This is not at night so let's go slowly. I'm sad to come in, though I'll be back.

5
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:30,062
Sushi.

6
00:01:30,062 --> 00:01:45,127
Alright OK.

7
00:01:45,127 --> 00:02:00,126
When I defeated the enemy, I got a lot of coins. I want to.

8
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:15,124
go in. That time is almost full. Also, the castle stage will be difficult.

9
00:02:15,124 --> 00:02:30,057
Hoi Hoi.

10
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:45,059
place.

11
00:02:45,059 --> 00:03:00,131
Girls are Thaimen.

12
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:15,136
It's okay now.

13
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:45,108
Ok Ok Ok. There are a lot of enemies around here. I can call you now.

14
00:03:45,108 --> 00:04:00,122
Who is this?

15
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:30,078
Another way of saying that there is still room.

16
00:04:30,078 --> 00:04:45,103
I don't need money anymore. Get out of here.

17
00:04:45,103 --> 00:05:00,085
Bowser onion. There are quite a few stars here right now.

18
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:15,102
Calm down, why am I properly?

19
00:05:15,102 --> 00:05:30,094
Head over there, you really. Machida's Cook What? From a while ago.

20
00:05:30,094 --> 00:05:45,124
Don't panic just because you got a star.

21
00:05:45,124 --> 00:06:00,114
Press it again.

22
00:06:00,114 --> 00:06:15,075
However.

23
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:30,113
Thank you for the star here.

24
00:06:30,113 --> 00:06:45,112
Hell picture, isn't it?

25
00:06:45,112 --> 00:07:00,125
It's not 1-1 like this. National confectionery store. Cutlet curry.

26
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:15,112
Gunma Seriously.

27
00:07:15,112 --> 00:07:30,081
I could go except for the block, but I registered.

28
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:45,129
If it was a play battle, what is it now? For now, I relied too much on roulette at the end.

29
00:07:45,129 --> 00:08:00,109
Fun heart at home Final phase Full of fun 7 Bowser. I'm nervous.

30
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:15,106
I hate the stage the most, but on the stage I hate.

31
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:30,103
At first, calm down and pick up coins. I don't know.

32
00:08:30,103 --> 00:08:45,114
On Mars.

33
00:08:45,114 --> 00:09:15,053
Jump.

34
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:30,140
It's okay.

35
00:09:30,140 --> 00:10:00,136
But not. Not.

36
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:15,162
Kyoei Fire That was exactly the hell of today. Bubble 6 there.

37
00:10:15,162 --> 00:10:30,116
How do you do this in 1-1? The bubble is strong **. Should I use the other party?

38
00:10:30,116 --> 00:10:45,144
There won't be a 1-12 bubble over there either, everyone. This is an interesting special course.

39
00:10:45,144 --> 00:11:00,119
I'll do it. Fire.

40
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:15,094
If you go ahead without worrying about it. You came.

41
00:11:15,094 --> 00:11:45,071
It's a mecha.

42
00:11:45,071 --> 00:12:00,148
Let's calm down City 4 So it's the easiest, right here.

43
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:15,123
Evacuate and ok. I want to get off the mecha.

44
00:12:15,123 --> 00:12:30,101
Slowly.

45
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:45,099
Ikedan's Fire Osugi is OK.

46
00:12:45,099 --> 00:13:00,132
I'm really scared. Natural products I'm scared. Install and.

47
00:13:00,132 --> 00:13:15,121
It feels good. Hayato Guidance Girls.

48
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:30,089
The world now. I want to defeat an enemy player somewhere.

49
00:13:30,089 --> 00:14:00,100
It's a point. Twice-cooked meat. I'm praying for small fish here.

50
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:15,119
Bowser is out. Money I didn't have yet.

51
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:30,082
I hope it's on the big deck.

52
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:45,091
Mr. Kawashima I'm sorry but above.

53
00:14:45,091 --> 00:15:00,135
It's not the 21st, because the opening hell is about to begin. Not over there.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,115
I want to leave my voice and say hello. Golf mechanism.

55
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:30,099
This time you guys.

56
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:45,099
disappeared. Mottainai Mottainai. You can't beat the one above.

57
00:00:45,099 --> 00:01:00,116
Cultured things.

58
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:15,110
5 people.

59
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:30,096
I'm still looking at it.

60
00:01:30,096 --> 00:02:00,084
Omura has a bad time. Bowser.

61
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:15,096
I got it only here.

62
00:02:15,096 --> 00:02:30,141
I often earn time. I also defeated and harassed my enemies.

63
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:45,148
Defeat it. You can stop it.

64
00:02:45,148 --> 00:03:00,059
Alright.

65
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:15,143
I can't earn Tristage Atime, so if I don't hurry, I'm really serious. This is tight This is tight.

66
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:30,132
White stage I don't feel heavy.

67
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:45,149
I see. This child who may like the most on the course.

68
00:03:45,149 --> 00:04:00,098
1 Narita City. let's go.

69
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:15,109
Also the opening. It's a peaceful stage.

70
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:45,168
Take me and the cat coin properly.

71
00:04:45,168 --> 00:05:15,159
Castle stage. Yes Yes Yes Yes.

72
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:45,145
Bowser coming tonden Kupaki Tonden 1-12.

73
00:05:45,145 --> 00:06:15,136
I can deal with it. By the way.

74
00:06:15,136 --> 00:06:30,135
I'm not so late. 2 1-1.

75
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:45,095
Interesting stage is pasted while being careful. The time is a little bad.

76
00:06:45,095 --> 00:07:00,116
It's still good now, but after this.

77
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:15,127
That's what it's like to keep having fun on this day. Stock price here.

78
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:30,044
Put on.

79
00:07:30,044 --> 00:07:45,100
Calm down now.

80
00:07:45,100 --> 00:08:00,109
Time stop.

81
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:15,134
Delivery.

82
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:30,166
I made a shit-like mistake I made a shit-like mistake and fell. I'm sorry. This was like a fool, I'm sorry.

83
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:45,130
If you reduce it. I thought it would arrive somehow. Fuck.

84
00:08:45,130 --> 00:09:00,125
Yonago. The price is not good.

85
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:15,130
I don't know a little. But it's good that I got it right away.

86
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:30,122
Defeat it with a poster. There is a little room here.

87
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:45,116
Isn't it a hell picture? You've seen Super Technique.

88
00:09:45,116 --> 00:10:00,142
Let's calm down I'm really.

89
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:15,087
I'll be late. calm down. What do you want to be calm?

90
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:30,224
I think this will not be defeated anymore.

91
00:10:30,224 --> 00:11:15,083
You can calm down.

92
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:30,111
Direction. It's scary. It's a lie.

93
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:45,128
I wonder what it is now.

94
00:11:45,128 --> 00:12:00,107
Well, it's fun if there are so many things you can do.

95
00:12:00,107 --> 00:12:15,089
Why should I do it?

96
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:30,111
Let's calm down.

97
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:45,092
V-cinema.

98
00:12:45,092 --> 00:13:15,160
This time, I can't beat the player, so I have a lot of coins.

99
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:30,109
Interesting stage.

100
00:13:30,109 --> 00:14:00,139
I'm not scared, the passage here. over there. I went to the bar in the back.

101
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:15,113
I'm scared.

102
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:30,139
I want to take a warp, but it's an impossible scam.

103
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:45,126
I have no choice but to buy it.

104
00:14:45,126 --> 00:15:00,047
@you know.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,121
Enchantment is 10.

106
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:30,133
Gatsby's case is still there.

107
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:45,138
Well I survived I survived a little I survived a little. When it comes out, my Tsum. Although the ancient writings of March still survive.

108
00:00:45,138 --> 00:01:15,116
Chasing you. I wonder. Right now.

109
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:45,161
Macross is flowing, isn't it?

110
00:01:45,161 --> 00:02:00,106
The reason why I couldn't get the floor here was that there were some shops that were defeated.

111
00:02:00,106 --> 00:02:15,144
Defeat it properly with cola. Hoi Hoi Hoi Hoi.

112
00:02:15,144 --> 00:02:30,106
Defeating the enemy is also reasonable.

113
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:45,124
Japan is not sent so much to the enemy.

114
00:02:45,124 --> 00:03:00,122
Moreover, you defeated the enemy. I'm glad I got some coins.

115
00:03:00,122 --> 00:03:15,143
I don't know what the castle is, it's not what the birds do. Sex recovery cover.

116
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:30,109
I goofed. The point here.

117
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:45,149
Hold a hammer or hang out. Can you go down?

118
00:03:45,149 --> 00:04:30,180
start. The shop I sent.

119
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:45,138
It's kind of like me. Time on Mars.

120
00:04:45,138 --> 00:05:00,154
Where are you first? That in the bubble wilderness.

121
00:05:00,154 --> 00:05:15,105
What's on the other side of the stairs? I'll send you a lot.

122
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:30,129
I don't know.

123
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:45,149
With invincible time.

124
00:05:45,149 --> 00:06:00,154
Cow is difficult This is nice. You can clear it.

125
00:06:00,154 --> 00:06:30,146
Please come down.

126
00:06:30,146 --> 00:06:45,112
I felt it wasn't good, but let's go.

127
00:06:45,112 --> 00:07:00,100
I'm not good at the last stairs right away.

128
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:15,146
You say you're not good at stairs, even if you're not good at it.

129
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:30,161
That's why I'm not good at the last stairs here.

130
00:07:30,161 --> 00:08:00,158
I really hate it by a while ago. I should be able to go. If it looks like it's not interesting.

131
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:30,136
I took it in 7 minutes.

132
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:45,144
I haven't been coughing so much this time.

133
00:08:45,144 --> 00:09:15,099
6-4.

134
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:30,092
Everything you can cover later. I'm sorry for that too.

135
00:09:30,092 --> 00:09:45,113
No no no no no no no no no. Wakaba-san, I'll play for a while. Have a cup of tea.

136
00:09:45,113 --> 00:10:15,133
Don't regret it. Feel calm.

137
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:45,103
The point is yes. Test out. I want to earn.

138
00:10:45,103 --> 00:11:15,147
Calm down. Lake Haruna.

139
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:30,132
I can still do it I can still do it. I can still do it I can still do it.

140
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:45,111
I haven't sent the enemy over here.

141
00:11:45,111 --> 00:12:00,131
Only clear here. The station after Kabuto-kun from Duema.

142
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:15,207
Time earning here. Gochujang. I'll be back.

143
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:30,125
I've been a bee, but I wonder where I've forgotten.

144
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:45,107
I wonder what it was.

145
00:12:45,107 --> 00:13:15,091
I feel like that.

146
00:13:15,091 --> 00:14:00,138
met met met.

147
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:15,131
I still want to see it. Still more. Because this is strong.

148
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:30,122
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes.

149
00:14:30,122 --> 00:14:45,117
That flower.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,121
Become an enemy. Properly.

151
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:45,155
The ship just before the opening.

152
00:00:45,155 --> 00:01:00,122
Let's stop the pudding that seems to be directly at home. As much as possible.

153
00:01:00,122 --> 00:01:15,131
So it's not that difficult, though the terrain is fine.

154
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:30,134
It's okay here. Nothing comes, nothing is inspected.

155
00:01:30,134 --> 00:01:45,123
It's like this.

156
00:01:45,123 --> 00:02:00,168
And I did it this time without anyone touching it.

157
00:02:00,168 --> 00:02:15,173
Delivery Just for the first time for 1 hour. It's been an hour since the delivery started. You can sleep comfortably at the airport.

158
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:30,111
Thank you, there is also Mr. Open.

159
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:45,146
By the way, I wonder if I can sleep comfortably today. I don't know what to do. Is It was fun.

160
00:02:45,146 --> 00:03:00,173
It's already 2 o'clock because I got drunk. It's almost over.

161
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:15,148
Thank you for your registration. Thank you for your high evaluation. Please subscribe My CHANNEL. I'm sorry I didn't say that. Good quality Himedai Uruse.

162
00:03:15,148 --> 00:03:30,159
My name is Yukihime. Thanks to Morioka, I feel like I can do my best tomorrow's work.

163
00:03:30,159 --> 00:04:00,118
Kunisaki Peninsula By the way, it's okay to always have a girl, lay it down.

164
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:15,147
Thank you Congratulations on number one. today AT Nya Nya Nyao It was saved.

165
00:04:15,147 --> 00:04:30,149

166
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:45,126
Then again.
