What should I do with today's rice? I told you that I'm addicted to eating that rice and salmon.

10
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:33,351
I wonder if I should do this today. It was decided. Save it.

11
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:48,409
Today's rice is here. It's the roof today.

12
00:02:48,409 --> 00:03:03,337
Now, I want to eat something after a long time. I want to eat it when I remember. Because, it's not so much.

13
00:03:03,337 --> 00:03:18,373

Yesterday yesterday. However. I don't know how lonely I am just with the delivery information.

18
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:33,390
If there isn't one, I want to do it every day. But once a week. I mean I can do it, so I'm getting a break, but as a feeling.

19
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:48,334
I'm having fun like that.

20
00:04:48,334 --> 00:05:03,344

21
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:18,351
House. It's great to have Nyan.

24
00:05:48,406 --> 00:06:03,472
The uniform of the Mokurou sofa was 10 yen, which looks great.

25
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:18,389
Thank you Momoe-san, thank you Kyu-san, thank you for the chocolate souvenirs. For porridge T-shirts at the booth. I bought four snails each.

32
00:07:48,392 --> 00:08:03,392
I'll give you a video of a satellite of credit, and it's messed up when it becomes like that. If not, it may be one year at this time.

33
00:08:03,392 --> 00:08:18,393
Thank you for your nostalgia. Capacitor.

34
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:33,398
Surprise shoes like a collaboration. The joy is in the rear tie. What do you want to say? Certainly I was the last rice ball with everyone.

35
00:08:33,398 --> 00:08:48,396
I wanted to know the coins early. I'm talking about something that isn't good for people who have been bitten today because there are so many today.

36
00:08:48,396 --> 00:09:03,389
I'm really worried about what it is. But surely I got hooked as everyone says.

37
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:18,380
That's the joy of having me in this collaboration with Lawson. I think so much, boxer. That's right, I'm this.

38
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:33,386
Don't think. I like to think that this person thought so. I thought it was asuka.

39
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:48,419
I was addicted to him, but I talked to him, but I'm still addicted to Purgatory-san's new.

40
00:09:48,419 --> 00:10:03,337
I thought that was the case, thinking about various things.

41
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:18,384
I'm glad that there are many things to see later after the supply has accumulated, and I'm addicted to it early. I think it's good to be happy, but in the end it's good or bad.

42
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:33,415
What makes me happy is that he loves me so much that I think that way. Do rice.

43
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:48,392
Thank you for your spoiling. The alumni association is so cute I'll definitely get it.

44
00:10:48,392 --> 00:11:03,411
It seems that I can't watch the delivery for a while because I have something to do, so I'd be happy if you could send me an email.

45
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:18,387

That reception period for that birthday gift. I wrote it for the time being, but in February. 8 isn't it?

50
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:33,373
It's a birthday present, but it's also like that on a maho.

51
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:48,386
Despite being in a position, this is something. It's a little embarrassing in the city. You can get it. It's embarrassing, but it's February.

52
00:12:48,386 --> 00:13:03,387
I'll get a letter, so don't write a letter like beauty or something like that. Something like a letter.

53
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:18,378
If there is a difference, please refer to that person. I'm going to talk about it on the premise that I can get something like Manpuku.

54
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:33,322
Tell me what that is. Yes, that's how it feels.

55

Thank you, I'm sorry, I have a question to buy a maiden.

57
00:14:03,357 --> 00:14:18,371
When I said that I like that one, the conversation has decreased since then. With me. I would be grateful if you could give the opinions of really beautiful people. I'm not used to it.

58
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:33,361
Is that different from that? Everyone. It can be caught like that.

61
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:25,073
That over there. So as for what is being said. That's why it's difficult.

62
00:15:25,073 --> 00:15:40,072
It's difficult. I just wish I could wait.

63
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:55,116
The truth is, it's in the dark. Azure wind 3.
