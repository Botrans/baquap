1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:34,117
Don't experience the budding emotions.

2
00:00:34,117 --> 00:01:49,035
Yes. Alloid.

3
00:01:49,035 --> 00:02:04,043
The setlist has already been written, but this is before. I'm going home.

4
00:02:04,043 --> 00:02:19,020
If you sing this song. Roma voice Don't sleep.

5
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:34,064
Okita You may have asked if you were listening.

6
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:49,042
Shocking dad.

7
00:02:49,042 --> 00:03:04,034
I'm thinking.

8
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:19,028
Let's do music.

9
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:49,038
Latery. I feel sleepy. Fight.

10
00:03:49,038 --> 00:04:34,038
A.v.v.

11
00:04:34,038 --> 00:08:49,010
I made it a singing voice. Now. It looks like a Western music anime song today.

12
00:08:49,010 --> 00:09:04,044
But I thought it was a little scary to go without checking anything. No, different names are okay, different, different, chow chow.

13
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:19,080
Yes. Ratery is very beautiful, isn't it? I wish I could sing.

14
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:34,021
Ignore something on the piano I feel like it's turbulent.

15
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:49,043
Chou Ikimonogakari's.

16
00:09:49,043 --> 00:12:04,056
The window broke.

17
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:19,975
waiting.

18
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:49,970
do not know.

19
00:12:49,970 --> 00:13:04,054
Suddenly. Maybe if you make it, it's a melody.

20
00:13:04,054 --> 00:14:04,052
Hahaha. The sound of the moment. Thank you very much. blue.

21
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:19,086
Bluebird is also in Tosa Western music.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:15:52,071
The current connection.

23
00:15:52,071 --> 00:16:07,027
Recording 2.

24
00:16:07,027 --> 00:16:22,073
That's okay. What is the video I'll give you today impulsively? I think it's taken.

25
00:16:22,073 --> 00:16:37,063
Pets within a week. Please go. maybe.

26
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:52,041
For Lee Lee. I wonder if you can understand it. You can tell from the atmosphere.

27
00:16:52,041 --> 00:17:22,083
It's okay when you're talking about the origin.

28
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:37,081
Yesterday's song yesterday. This too.

29
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:52,050
Is it suddenly?

30
00:17:52,050 --> 00:18:22,077
I'll show you how many times I lost. The sky with a rainbow.

31
00:18:22,077 --> 00:20:37,015
Robot Ebisu.

32
00:20:37,015 --> 00:21:22,067
I'm sorry but I'm going. Even me.

33
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:37,053
Osawa Aeon.

34
00:21:37,053 --> 00:22:37,979
erase.

35
00:22:37,979 --> 00:23:07,031
Welcome to Mr. Nagata for the first time. Come on, come on S. When did you go?

36
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:22,082
It's not a masterpiece, isn't it? I'll tell you because I don't have one. Welcome now.

37
00:23:22,082 --> 00:23:37,075
How many songs?

38
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:52,131
It's my first look. Only Chotaro Saemon Tamura-san is searched.

39
00:23:52,131 --> 00:24:07,063
I'm glad if you comment on something. Then, if you say so, Porno Graffitti.

40
00:24:07,063 --> 00:24:22,120
gall bladder. I don't want to say it's a night alone. I may not be doing this much. GTO.

41
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:52,068
For the time being, Saudade. It may not be possible.

42
00:24:52,068 --> 00:25:22,057
OK, let's go.

43
00:25:22,057 --> 00:25:37,056
Secure first. 3.

44
00:25:37,056 --> 00:25:52,047
Hitorino night.

45
00:25:52,047 --> 00:26:22,982
Ultraman.

46
00:26:22,982 --> 00:27:22,078
As time goes on. Where is it like a tree?

47
00:27:22,078 --> 00:27:37,012
Even at the bottom of the sea. Not disturbed by anyone.

48
00:27:37,012 --> 00:29:37,051
I don't think there are fans who are messed up.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:29:54,983
What do you say fluffy? Tora Tora Tora is the one.

50
00:29:54,983 --> 00:30:09,944
this. This is.

51
00:30:09,944 --> 00:30:24,991
8 I'm fine.

52
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:54,903
not.

53
00:30:54,903 --> 00:31:24,986
Excuse me. I knitted straw.

54
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:54,950
Skate on the face of people going. Star 菫 sect.

55
00:31:54,950 --> 00:32:54,960
Lol lol 4.

56
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:39,908
Maybe.

57
00:33:39,908 --> 00:33:54,974
I thought I'd do it.

58
00:33:54,974 --> 00:34:09,978
Tototototototo. Ah, this, this, this, this. This.

59
00:34:09,978 --> 00:34:24,994
This hurt. As usual, the song selection is messy.

60
00:34:24,994 --> 00:34:39,983
Taro somewhere.

61
00:34:39,983 --> 00:34:54,955
About -4.

62
00:34:54,955 --> 00:35:24,914
Kingdom. too high.

63
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:39,958
This is about this.

64
00:35:39,958 --> 00:36:09,904
Maybe.

65
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:39,972
Jojo. Exploration.

66
00:36:39,972 --> 00:36:54,994
I will go this.

67
00:36:54,994 --> 00:37:24,968
Fun Lefranc.

68
00:37:24,968 --> 00:38:09,969
This is a delicate concert.

69
00:38:09,969 --> 00:38:24,897
keyboard.

70
00:38:24,897 --> 00:38:54,980
This is really lost.

71
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:09,957
I wouldn't run out of money so much.

72
00:39:09,957 --> 00:39:24,928
You may not know.

73
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:39,945
To meet.

74
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:54,966
Now as two.

75
00:39:54,966 --> 00:40:09,931
It's not a tree illustration.

76
00:40:09,931 --> 00:40:24,966
I couldn't come back. That's it. I don't do it except when.

77
00:40:24,966 --> 00:40:39,014
It's amazing.

78
00:40:39,014 --> 00:40:54,002
B Meloshikato If it's cold, you can go only at the beginning.

79
00:40:54,002 --> 00:41:24,962
Italy little by little.

80
00:41:24,962 --> 00:41:39,982
Freeze.

81
00:41:39,982 --> 00:41:54,975
It's about time to do it with Yam-chan.

82
00:41:54,975 --> 00:42:09,004
Melissa isn't I, I don't know. Is it just rust?

83
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:24,011
It's rusty from the beginning.

84
00:42:24,011 --> 00:43:09,973
A little bit. It has become.

85
00:43:09,973 --> 00:43:24,939
Is it Hagaren's song? It's not an album. I want to.

86
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:39,951
That song. In advance. Yes.

87
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:54,992
It's really difficult. It's called Angkor.

88
00:43:54,992 --> 00:44:24,008
If I was going home to you, I waved in the picture book.

89
00:44:24,008 --> 00:44:39,017
The world will end tomorrow.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:44:56,892
Surrounded by darkness.

91
00:44:56,892 --> 00:45:11,942
This is the end of the world without night brothers.

92
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:26,917
go. Take a video.

93
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:56,897
Kimi Iro Omoi.

94
00:45:56,897 --> 00:46:11,882
Single car.

95
00:46:11,882 --> 00:47:11,928
Rather than setting the clock.

96
00:47:11,928 --> 00:48:26,899
Make a sound when you get off.

97
00:48:26,899 --> 00:48:56,946
The world will end tomorrow. If the world doesn't end.

98
00:48:56,946 --> 00:49:11,885
At that time, two people together.

99
00:49:11,885 --> 00:49:26,842
rest assured. no.

100
00:49:26,842 --> 00:49:41,914
I wonder if I can sing. I'm the store manager.

101
00:49:41,914 --> 00:50:11,931
I'm thinking of asking a lot. In memory.

102
00:50:11,931 --> 00:50:26,923
No, this is it.

103
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:41,901
Totonon.

104
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:56,965
Do this. When I put it on Notepad, the emoji disappeared. 8.

105
00:50:56,965 --> 00:51:11,933
it's here. Today's sound up. Ginkgo videos too.

106
00:51:11,933 --> 00:51:26,044
While reminding me. Please look forward to that area as well.

107
00:51:26,044 --> 00:51:41,887
RT Thank you. Alright.

108
00:51:41,887 --> 00:51:56,934
seriously. I'm going to get angry. You can make your song properly and everyone will break it.

109
00:51:56,934 --> 00:52:11,916
Absolute time.

110
00:52:11,916 --> 00:52:26,908
I myself. this. Maybe this can be done.

111
00:52:26,908 --> 00:52:41,853
Stop. Well then.

112
00:52:41,853 --> 00:52:56,881
Things you can rest assured Ima Nakamachi Anxiolytics are everything.

113
00:52:56,881 --> 00:53:11,911
Yanai is really safe. Some people can do this well.

114
00:53:11,911 --> 00:53:26,946
with this. This is a lie to erase the game chicken in Tama City.

115
00:53:26,946 --> 00:53:41,934
This is this. I had a little chopstick rest.

116
00:53:41,934 --> 00:53:56,923
The vertical thread.

117
00:53:56,923 --> 00:54:41,882
Will it come to terms?

118
00:54:41,882 --> 00:55:11,890
I don't always know.

119
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:26,948
Under the distant sky.

120
00:55:26,948 --> 00:57:41,936
People call it assortment.

121
00:57:41,936 --> 00:58:11,955
It was a thread. A feeling of red.

122
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:26,932
Somehow. The senses are amazing, isn't it? This is this.

123
00:58:26,932 --> 00:58:41,915
It's crazy. There is Miss Kyaba.

124
00:58:41,915 --> 00:59:11,898
Yoshi next. Akune city.

125
00:59:11,898 --> 00:59:26,889
I just did Hollow Knight. That's why I'll definitely do it.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:59:58,815
I'm being pulled a lot. I wonder if this is the case.

127
00:59:58,815 --> 01:00:13,820
I miss you aspirin.

128
01:00:13,820 --> 01:01:13,877
Make it close. ICOCA.

129
01:01:13,877 --> 01:06:13,790
was.

130
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:28,872
The video is 8.

131
01:06:28,872 --> 01:06:43,798
2 hours.

132
01:06:43,798 --> 01:06:58,864
Fly Me To The Moon. Break it down.

133
01:06:58,864 --> 01:07:13,857
I wonder if I can read Spotcha in Tasaki. 8.

134
01:07:13,857 --> 01:07:28,857
Meta Knight Face Face Left and right are different Thank you Sue-san Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your dizziness in the morning. Thank you Queen Thank you Meg.

01:08:28,843 --> 01:08:58,871
There are you on my favorite. I only know here.

140
01:08:58,871 --> 01:09:13,832
I thought it was done well. Konica Cup 10 class up.

141
01:09:13,832 --> 01:09:28,847
It's a phone. I'm sorry.

142
01:09:28,847 --> 01:09:43,850
Approximately.

143
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:58,878
Conan song.

144
01:09:58,878 --> 01:10:13,853
With a fluke.

145
01:10:13,853 --> 01:10:28,869
It's over. It is in it.

146
01:10:28,869 --> 01:10:43,845
I'm fine.
