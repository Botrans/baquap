1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:09:00,135
Please wait a moment, everyone.

2
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:15,114
3. Do you want Hanasaki Miyabi.

3
00:09:15,114 --> 00:09:30,130
You can hear it, isn't it? So everyone today. What is it, but I want to do it. Teke Teke Teke Teke Teke. Teke Teke.

4
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:45,185
That Japanese horror horror story Horror urban legend is a kind of horror story. It's close to that kind of series.

5
00:09:45,185 --> 00:10:00,171
I wonder what the salt in Hokkaido says. I heard that I was run over by a train or a train. Sega.

6
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:15,175
What do you say? You were hit by a train and separated, right?

7
00:10:15,175 --> 00:10:30,141
The blood vessels in the mouth when the upper half of the garden was separated are condensed. But in the state of colosseum. It's like chasing after you.

8
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:45,162

9
00:10:45,162 --> 00:11:00,217
I would like to play such a game this time. I didn't play a Teke Teke game at the time of your schedule. It's like playing tag, but if you decide to play Teke Teke, you'll lose in rock-paper-scissors.

10
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:15,136
I used to play it when I was in kindergarten, but when I say Teke Teke game. Playing tag.

11
00:11:15,136 --> 00:11:30,188
It's a game of crawl on all fours and chase after you, but that's the house. It's my servant. Do it relatively, I'm a person.

12
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:45,113
It's an absolute lie, because today I just made my first game.

13
00:11:45,113 --> 00:12:00,147
That's right, let's play a new game. Do you want to do it? I don't think I've ever had a lower body.

14
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:15,117

00:13:30,163 --> 00:13:45,103
Gifu. Everything is OK. I didn't understand.

21
00:13:45,103 --> 00:14:00,108
In other words, I don't know, but it means that I've gone underground. Sunday. No is needed.

22
00:14:00,108 --> 00:14:15,056
thank you, thank you, thank you. Coming. Thank you.

23
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:30,133

24
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:45,091
Spinach item. The shift runs.

25
00:14:45,091 --> 00:15:00,120
It's been three days and if he's okay. It takes. 7th The girl from earlier.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,077
What is this? Is it the subway? new.

27
00:00:15,077 --> 00:00:30,096
Not sweet. I like Suntory a little. I wonder if I really am.

28
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:45,124
It may not be sweet, it's not me, is it still me? Coffee and milk. I have to use.

29
00:00:45,124 --> 00:01:00,101
Wow, it's really complicated, isn't it? Oh dear. The left back and maybe that is the toilet.

30
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:15,173
The settings are amazing for everyone. Is this the only setting? mouse. Because there is only this, let's go.

31
00:01:15,173 --> 00:01:30,140
It's weird so no one is there. I'm a girl.

32
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:45,151
Man. Isn't it a man?

33
00:01:45,151 --> 00:02:00,150
Yes Yes Is it okay? But put it in. I'm a girl, so I can't enter because I'm a girl.

34
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:15,190
Yes Yes Yes Yes. Mama Mama is famous for the shops I've seen somewhere. Twitter.

35
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:30,190
Sound It's a little scary.

36
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:45,159
It's a good size, isn't it? It's okay to lower the sound a little together. To lower the sound. After all.

37
00:02:45,159 --> 00:03:00,144
It's the strongest sound in a game like this. what.

38
00:03:00,144 --> 00:03:15,108
The driver. Loosen or warm the screws.

39
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:30,171
I don't have this, I have this Aika I love Evently. There is nothing in particular. That's it.

40
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:45,055
Is it?

41
00:03:45,055 --> 00:04:00,158
Um, that's why I'm so crazy because everyone thinks it's due to the specifications of this game. Well, I'm the one who worked hard even with this.

42
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:15,124
Then we will arrive in 6 minutes. No 1.

43
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:30,156
Because it's a fire alarm. It doesn't work It doesn't work What is it that no one comes out? What is this child looking for in the moon?

44
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:45,097
Then it may be a telephone. What I found out now is shoes.

45
00:04:45,097 --> 00:05:00,154
You can't do anything without a fuse. That's good, I went to the bathroom with my wife. I think there is a place where you can tighten the screws, but this is the place.

46
00:05:00,154 --> 00:05:15,168
There is nothing. Early, huh. Please cooperate.

47
00:05:15,168 --> 00:05:30,132

50
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:15,086
It's not cute. Already.

51
00:06:15,086 --> 00:06:30,100
This is the screw that I use. I can't use this either. This of Medina. I have no choice but to give up. I have no choice but to give up.

52
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:45,092
Today's delivery for adults, should this be the end? How was Teke Teke? I couldn't even go home.

53
00:06:45,092 --> 00:07:00,143
Don't forget about 3 minutes before the woman. The name you really know is strange. What do you mean?

54
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:15,136
It's stopped, but everyone helped. Ichimatsu Let's search from here.

55
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:30,120
With a screwdriver. Cardboard. I'm sure there is nothing.

56
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:45,141
Night personal computer. I think I can't use my computer anytime. I'm the only one who wraps it up.

57
00:07:45,141 --> 00:08:00,128
Especially, I don't think I can use a personal computer. Setting. How is it walking too much?

58
00:08:00,128 --> 00:08:15,125
It's bright though. Is it wrong. This is it.

59
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:30,120
I want you to wait for this.

60
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:45,132
I'm getting thinner. core.

61
00:08:45,132 --> 00:09:00,165
Absolutely chestnut bean paste. I don't want to go. From the back. A tactic that is not scary if you go from behind.

62
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:15,108
It's a little nice. You don't have to do this. About the toilet.

63
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:30,114
Women's men's toilet.

64
00:09:30,114 --> 00:10:00,167
I can't seem to lose. Then I'm not in the men's toilet. Should not be in the men's toilet. All together.

65
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:15,118

I wonder if my mouth is open. Would you like to go?

72

It's really bright. It's really light. The country is.

73
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:15,091
Somehow I look at the map map. I didn't write a map right now.

74
00:12:15,091 --> 00:12:30,153
Looking at the map, I think it was written now. It should come soon, but it should come soon.

75
00:12:30,153 --> 00:12:45,126
Not from today.

76
00:12:45,126 --> 00:13:15,071

Thanks. Good evening Karatsu. Oh yeah yeah Chirazu Art-san's joint development Maybe that little.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,143
There is something today. There is something. Someone was like a detective criminal.

85
00:00:15,143 --> 00:00:30,119
I wonder if I'm going over there this house. Please come in. Do you want to do it?

86
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:45,089
It opened. It opened. Are you going from home? Wait a minute, uh.

Tell me to go upstairs. Go upstairs. Toilet car.

You're such a toilet. I told you it wasn't in here. partner.

94
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:45,133

95
00:02:45,133 --> 00:03:00,136
Arlandis. There was a certain person now. What is it now?

96

Arlandis, thank you.

97
00:03:15,088 --> 00:03:30,201
I'm sorry for my head, Ear-kun, Arantes. It was there, but it was pasted. What are you doing so far?

98
00:03:30,201 --> 00:03:45,126
I can do something. There is nothing. There are only 3 here.

99
00:03:45,126 --> 00:04:00,144
After that. Because the timer can't do anything. This one?

100
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:15,131
It doesn't feel like a sudden and real acting. Can not be.

101
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:30,139
Not in this world. What do you mean?

102
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:45,061
Four.

103
00:04:45,061 --> 00:05:30,160
It's sly, isn't it a wasteful voice? It's kind of like this kind of game. It's like you're the only one. A little.

104
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:45,159
I was surprised that he was acting too seriously. A boy who measures a boy who measures.

105
00:05:45,159 --> 00:06:00,132
First of all. I told you what to say. Would you like to sign it?

106
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:15,147
To prove that I'm a hit.

Somehow the clock. This is but as an item.

109
00:06:45,156 --> 00:07:00,122
Door stop. Door stop.

110
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:15,162

Eight came and used all of them. That's right here.

113
00:07:45,103 --> 00:08:00,141
Mostly not. Utada's picture doesn't react at all. Welcome.

114
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:15,119
this. I will use it later.

115

It's used behind the door to prevent it from opening. Prevent the door from opening.

116
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:45,077
this is. I was surprised and jumped a lot.

117
00:08:45,077 --> 00:09:00,131
And this closet doesn't contain anything either. I found something.

118
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:15,093
Tuna can. I found a tuna can. The hammer.

119
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:30,156
Tuna and Hammer I found Tuna and Hammer. There is nothing around here.

120
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:45,076
There is nothing. There isn't. I can't open them all.

121
00:09:45,076 --> 00:10:00,101
Approximately. I've checked this out.

122
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:15,117
Not included. What is it? The sound was cut off.

123
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:30,130
Meat-like hammer Meat-like hammer. Shattering tuna cans with a hammer or something like that.

124

There is nothing in it. I haven't seen it here either. There isn't.

126
00:11:00,097 --> 00:11:15,132
When you say that. Destroy the Landes flower.

127
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:30,136
I'm sorry I'm 3 gods. This is broken, this is the money.

128
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:45,096
Next is.

129
00:11:45,096 --> 00:12:00,144
What should I do? Didn't you come with this? I have to feed this child a can of tuna.

130
00:12:00,144 --> 00:12:15,129
Meat hammer.

131
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:30,112
Something like me. It looks like no good. I can't seem to eat it.

132
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:45,119
I wonder if I can go. With a command combine.

133
00:12:45,119 --> 00:13:00,158
There is something outside this. There is something. There is nothing.

134
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:15,129
Something is written.

135
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:30,156

It's not good here, there is a mysterious barrier. Donald.

138
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:15,118
I can't go there either.

139
00:14:15,118 --> 00:14:30,153
I did this. I thought I had just been there, but I was a little wondering if this was the end of today's delivery.

140
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:45,127
Let's go home. I have no choice but to do something in this house. Which one is this?

141
00:14:45,127 --> 00:15:00,131
I'll make it dark. Also. I haven't done it yet.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,119
It doesn't say here. N Kitchen I've taken control of everything.

143
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:30,104
There is something I haven't done yet. I can't save this game, so when I'm done with my dog, it's over.

144
00:00:30,104 --> 00:00:45,137
I can't do it anymore. There is only a hammer.

145
00:00:45,137 --> 00:01:00,122
Do you go twice? On LINE. There seems to be nothing. here.

00:01:00,122 --> 00:01:15,126
Don't stay overnight. scared. Yes Yes Yes Yes.

147
00:01:15,126 --> 00:01:30,097

No, this is an evently event. What is this?

149
00:01:45,117 --> 00:02:00,091
This is after all. Break it with Korejanai's Meat Hammer Hammer.

150
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:15,084
How many tuna cans do you give to kittens? There is a cat somewhere.

151
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:30,130
Looking for a cat. That kind of thing.

152
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:45,093
this. That's right. The tongue is tiny.

153
00:02:45,093 --> 00:03:00,149
somehow. It means that the items are different, isn't it?

154
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:15,100
There is something that can be combined with that hammer. Then, look for it and say.

155
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:30,155
I wonder what it is. I feel like I'm looking for an item. Do you want to see one by one?

156
00:03:30,155 --> 00:03:45,150
Kotokasaki. Die. It may be a strange point. There are no acupoints on Wednesday. I'm crazy.

157
00:03:45,150 --> 00:04:00,143
Right now. That's right, I don't get any injuries.

158
00:04:00,143 --> 00:04:15,133
There are kitchen knives, though. The windows can be opened at all.

159
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:30,101
What do you know now? That's it for now.

160
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:45,136
Can you put it in 8 times? I haven't gone to Okugawa.

161
00:04:45,136 --> 00:05:00,128
I can go but there is nothing. Something is wrong. No, but maybe there's nothing here, are you going home?

162
00:05:00,128 --> 00:05:15,155
El Karamatsu I have to help measure it. After all it is above this.

163
00:05:15,155 --> 00:05:30,115
Let's take a look. That's it here.

164
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:45,101
I have a feeling. Oh there. there. Amon.

165
00:05:45,101 --> 00:06:00,075
I'm Le Saint Torre.

166
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:15,119
I have a bad feeling about this, but maybe this is it. A daddy has fallen down, but I wonder if this is okay.

167
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:45,123
R 3 R 3 You shouldn't fall down. Because this is obvious. Take a rest, I'm a horror.

168
00:06:45,123 --> 00:07:15,108
You can't open it from here in the first place. There is such a thing. You can see it here for a moment.

169
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:30,123
This. Door stopper.

170
00:07:30,123 --> 00:07:45,110
Ah this is that kind of thing. I mean, if you go here.

171
00:07:45,110 --> 00:08:00,122
You're a genius, everyone. Nakamachi. What is this here?

172
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:15,149
Even so, it's a great two-dimensional picture. She seems to have died suffering over time after being hit by a train.

173
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:30,162
Scotch from the railroad tracks. Shortly afterwards, she was hurt because some cats were approaching her on her teeth.

174
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:45,129
I started eating. It keeps screaming that no one notices.

175
00:08:45,129 --> 00:09:00,106
Many people believe that the house is afraid of cats. Is it really true? Beautiful woman. Anyway, three.

176
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:15,164
It's supposed to be, but that's strange. It's really bright. I can't see anything. Look at me now.

177
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:30,134
What happened But I didn't see anything because I went from behind. From the back.

178
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:45,150
Without seeing anything. Can continue. After all.

179
00:09:45,150 --> 00:10:00,167
But I'm glad that he fell down, but it was safe.

180
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:15,121
It was safe. I mean, I didn't see anything. what.

181
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:30,150
Do you feel like you want to do it once? In terms of. There is nothing. Do you go out once?

182
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:45,118
What happened

183
00:10:45,118 --> 00:11:00,168
I didn't see it, I didn't see anything until now because I had a tactical strategy. I have to do something about this. A daddy The second win measured in the photo above.

00:11:00,168 --> 00:11:15,095
A picture that I can't go to. I got it. this. let's go.

185
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:30,104
Show me the ikebo from earlier. I went to the movie that day. I didn't, but for the time being, I saw it till the end.

Please take a look here at all. I have a hamster.

187
00:11:45,121 --> 00:12:00,149
But I can measure it.

188
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:15,112
I've attacked I've taken it I've taken it Hakuba. I understand something.

189
00:12:15,112 --> 00:12:30,137
Volume. I can no longer feel secure in my house. But weird.

190
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:45,118
In the old mansion of my grandfather just around the corner. You can rest assured that Haruka Koga will be there. It was supposed to be.

191
00:12:45,118 --> 00:13:00,161
Shortly before I sprinted, my grandfather told me my old lover gave him him. Welcome to Hanami-gumi. I don't know what this is written.

192
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:15,186
In other words, there is no use here anymore. Bye bye. DoCoMo can't help it.

193
00:13:15,186 --> 00:13:30,106
You measured it now.

194
00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:45,123

00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:30,121
why. There is something. Great Demon King Song.

198
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:45,114
It doesn't look like it. For the toilet. There is nothing.

199
00:14:45,114 --> 00:15:00,128
Takeda: I don't think so. You entered.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,125
I broke in. Miyabi trespassing.

201
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:30,076
A little light. Can be opened. There is no such thing.

202

There is no way to find Mahagaru. 920 It's started.

203
00:00:45,185 --> 00:01:00,098
I can't fight at Saiki Night in hot water. I'm used to it, but it's a cat.

204
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:15,131

Let's move on for the time being. Let's go to the sea. It's getting a little heavier.

207
00:01:45,101 --> 00:02:00,148
This is not dangerous. Wait a minute.

208
00:02:00,148 --> 00:02:15,097
Let's get it, get it. No, no, no, this is it.

209
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:30,099
That's right, the game is that, isn't it? It's really heavy 8. It's really good.

210
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:45,155
It's really crazy. There is incense.

He said he shouldn't go in. He locked the door and locked it in a pillow or in a wall.

218
00:04:30,134 --> 00:04:45,171
I sneaked into the crab at random, but nothing changed. Why did he get me up there? Now and.

00:04:45,171 --> 00:05:00,119
I said it was in the pillow. Internal medicine There is no such house.

Not here. I got another 5000.

224
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:15,162
Two for the time being. But Seri-san, that's it. A mini incense stick was set, but is that so?

225
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:30,125
This is an incense stick here. It says it's necessary. There is another one.

226
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:45,171
There isn't. I don't know. I feel like that.

Nothing.

Try to move. That's why. Some of the usual questions. Nothing Nothing Nothing. It's amazing.

233
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:30,147
What were you hiding?

234
00:08:30,147 --> 00:08:45,122
This is definitely there.

235
00:08:45,122 --> 00:09:00,102
It's impossible tomorrow. Where does this tail really look like a cat? There is nothing.

236
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:15,098
There is nothing. Did you do Senko?

A woman visits and is down-suspended by her. It seems that Teke Teke will come within three days. It's spicy, I'm scared.

241
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:30,180
I'm sorry, what's next?

242
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:45,126

Really. Always say something under what name. But there is nothing.

245
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:30,105
Because here. Inside the pillow and the wall. It was written inside the wall.

246
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:45,150
I'm really curious about what people here are. Inside the wall. This is a really serious wall.

here. Ninja. Actually, there is something like a hidden door used by ninjas, so when you enter.

248

Pillows too. I was talking again. hanging scroll.

250

Where did you come from north?

252
00:13:00,105 --> 00:13:15,121
There is no entrance. Spicy. I wonder if it's here.

253
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:30,152
There is no hanging scroll here anymore. If there is more.

254
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:45,165
But it was also. It's over there, right here. this. On this bale.

Acolle. Life Yao or a video made of stone Sharpening whetstone This is a whetstone.

With this. I was able to combine this. It can be used to cut various objects.

263
00:00:45,084 --> 00:01:00,128
Is this a hanging scroll? You can also amputate a puppy.

If you see it again, you'll be an analyst. It seems to come out in parts. What are you doing?

281
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:30,151
I wonder if I have to move. We are here.

There is a candle in between. I will not take it. That's pretty much it.

293
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:45,127
You already know who I am, what is what? You heard my name is Kashima Reiko. My shape.

That kind of edge. It was forgiven. I was forgiven and forgiven now.

298
00:09:45,144 --> 00:10:00,133
I thought the game was over. It wasn't this.

299
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:15,179
But come on. I don't want to come. Tadaoka I haven't come to my mind right now.

Well to be a rare child. It was like that. Carrying Teke Teke All you have to do is bring your upper body.

304
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:30,154
I won't come. Oh yeah, in other words, I have no choice but to let Kashima Reiko do it.

305
00:11:30,154 --> 00:11:45,159
Should I get the button out? There is something that can be kicked.

306
00:11:45,159 --> 00:12:00,108
Nothing. I'm coming. On LINE.

307
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:15,158
I think it's sly to be surprised by the earphones and sound. The village of not being able to leave. You can't get out. What is this used for?

308
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:30,113
A piece of paper. Foreo.

309
00:12:30,113 --> 00:12:45,161
If you let others authenticate. I wonder if it's somewhere. Bicolor Kore 1-chan Kore Where did you die Doggy I don't know where.

310
00:12:45,161 --> 00:13:00,100
It's already here. It doesn't make much sense, everyone.

311
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:15,141
Umm. If there isn't a hurry solo around here, that.

312
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:30,138
Below this are three candles. I wonder if I need a flame. Let's use shoes. Because it's dyed.

313
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:45,117
Do you need flames? The voice when burning paper.

314
00:13:45,117 --> 00:14:00,091
It's no good, just because I can't go back. Tuna cans are no good either. Ah, sure.

315
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:15,140
I wonder what would happen if he was found. Yoochun. I know you can't come to this area by this house anyway.

316
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:30,172
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes. Alright here.

317
00:14:30,172 --> 00:14:45,120
I don't have it. OK. What is it?

318
00:14:45,120 --> 00:15:00,085
2. Water Water Water Water Water Water.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,070
Incense.

320
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:30,113
Because it was the same pattern as before. I wonder if it's somewhere.

321
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:45,102
I saw it before. Wow. I haven't seen it yet.

322
00:00:45,102 --> 00:01:00,115
I found it again. Please forgive me for a moment.

323
00:01:00,115 --> 00:01:15,122
I want to bring it back. What should I do?

324
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:30,189
Teke Teke 8. You shouldn't do this.

325
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:45,163
with this. Drunker. OK, OK, please let me know if you get sick again.

326
00:01:45,163 --> 00:02:00,163
I do. That's right. Hoi Hoi Hoi.

327
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:15,142
Something. I want legs.

328
00:02:15,142 --> 00:02:30,152
There are. No, it's a woman.

329
00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:45,060
That's right.

330
00:02:45,060 --> 00:03:15,158
Teke Teke. VS Teke Teke has begun.

331
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:30,103
There is nothing here. I'm forced to wake up.

332
00:03:30,103 --> 00:03:45,087
Stupid guy. This is bad, this is bad. What should I do? This is quite difficult.

333
00:03:45,087 --> 00:04:00,146
I want legs. crack. I'm not 100 times scared by calling out.

334
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:15,086
dash.

335
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:30,112
There is something. What's this. There is, but she is a high school teacher.

336
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:45,119
The student continued to her station. She was at a loss knowing that the student was obsessed with her. I remember my cousin I accidentally fell on the railroad track because of too much fear. Other than her.

337
00:04:45,119 --> 00:05:00,155
She mainly sleeps at night and in the morning. I'm killing malignancy.

338
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:15,195
It's okay to say that I like young men who are exclusively for high school boys. Is it a high school boy? I like young boys.

339
00:05:15,195 --> 00:05:30,106
Is this one of the incense sticks?

340
00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:45,115
Mama Mama Hey everyone's.

341
00:05:45,115 --> 00:06:00,046
There isn't.

342
00:06:00,046 --> 00:06:15,100
There isn't. I'm the opposite. This side.

343
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:30,073
It's not good if there is. If you have this one. so.

344
00:06:30,073 --> 00:06:45,138
I'm waiting. Maybe you need three. How much is it?

345
00:06:45,138 --> 00:07:00,132
I don't have legs. If you wait, they will grow. Only life is a forgiveness.

346
00:07:00,132 --> 00:07:15,100
Over there ZR 7. That person Come on. It's like an alarm.

347
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:30,116
The main body of Teke Teke. That's the system. so.

348
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:45,146
One incense stick. There is. Already. There is no choice but to thrust in, thrust in, thrust in, and thrust in.

349
00:07:45,146 --> 00:08:00,108
Absolutely there is one different key I found some key.

350
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:15,113
It's not here, this isn't this, isn't it? In other words, there is another line. The key.

351
00:08:15,113 --> 00:08:30,120
Another stomach. I'm sorry for a moment.

352
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:45,114
But maybe this room is this room. There must be a key for my game. Because it's out.

353
00:08:45,114 --> 00:09:00,131
2. It's strange to come.

354
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:15,135
What's going on with the item? This is also when you get the item.

355
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:30,144
Do you make an error? Nice to meet you kitten. It's one.

356
00:09:30,144 --> 00:09:45,113
You're sounding down, right?

357
00:09:45,113 --> 00:10:00,104
I went there. With insurance.

358
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:15,131
Isn't it there? I wonder if it's on the other side of the word that it's not here.

359
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:30,124
There is no key. It's about time to stop. Niigata City.

360
00:10:30,124 --> 00:10:45,140
If you come this far, don't worry. I hope you come this far.

361
00:10:45,140 --> 00:11:00,120
9 Not here. Stop it.

362
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:15,101
Up to here. This teke teke that doesn't seem to come here.

363
00:11:15,101 --> 00:11:30,118
Is it a comment?

364
00:11:30,118 --> 00:12:00,113
It's become more interesting. It's kind of like a DVD. It's inside me now. Good, good, good.

365
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:15,140
Oh, this is a woman that Shin-Shimizu doesn't have. This is bad. Books.

366
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:30,148
Maeda. It looks like it's rolled. Teke Teke.

367
00:12:30,148 --> 00:12:45,130
We won't stop. My sister has no choice but to fight. Come on together. I'll raise my legs.

368
00:12:45,130 --> 00:13:00,095
I can't find it. That's why there was one over there.

369
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:15,110
The key to the kitten. Ban-chan There's snow behind him. A little bit.

370
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:30,080
Teke Ten Teke-chan Teke Te Ke Te Ke Ke Ke Ke Ke

371
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:45,120
It's like that. Teru-chan's enemy, that was pretty good.

372
00:13:45,120 --> 00:14:00,110
Which is the left side of the bale?

373
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:15,116
If so, I knead it. Do you want to leave it behind?

374
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:30,112
This one.

375
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:45,083
This is a little that. The place is tight.

376
00:14:45,083 --> 00:15:00,118
This is bad. Yashio driving school reservation.

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,119
I can afford this.

378
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:30,118
This is it. No no.

379
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:45,116
I haven't even searched for this. White white guy. Rakusei. I want to go.

380
00:00:45,116 --> 00:01:15,090
here. This is the one. Lie. I saw it at the store.

381
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:30,143
This is what it is here too.

382
00:01:30,143 --> 00:01:45,111
Where is it over there? There was a luster like that in the back of that rice shop.

383
00:01:45,111 --> 00:02:00,131
For the feet.

384
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:15,059
No. Ah this? This is it. I found it.

385
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:45,094
I'm in a hurry. so.

386
00:02:45,094 --> 00:03:00,105
I got it. here. Paste and flies.

387
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:15,105
No, with this. You're watching. Yes Yes Yes Yes Ah Good It stopped so time.

388
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:30,091
Besides, this is that.

389
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:45,126
This is Koyakoya where she was. Would you like to offer it here?

390
00:03:45,126 --> 00:04:00,160
I found Akagi. And. It looks okay.

391
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:15,135
There is nothing. Offline table is N. Because there are no enemies.

392
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:30,121
I got the key so I'll go to the back. The key car here.

393
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:45,106
Electric train. There's a cat, cat. Where to put offerings From where to put.

394
00:04:45,106 --> 00:05:00,150
I have a chan. I wonder if it's okay to put in a weight that won't come out. Eat tuna cans.

395
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:15,107
It's a tuna can. I'm diving.

396
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:30,102
I wonder if there is something over there. Would you like to go there?

397
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:45,087
Doko-chan. Teke Teke.

398
00:05:45,087 --> 00:06:00,136
I saved you. The enemy is still alive, but you have escaped. I'm done.

399
00:06:00,136 --> 00:06:15,139
Ah, this is one game clear. The ritual is over. Teke Teke says he doesn't like cats.

400
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:30,140
I was saying that I hate cats and touch them. It's not a hassle.

401
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:45,120
I didn't really understand that offering at all, and even after that, something was offered. Seismic intensity 5 ending. You can choose somewhere.

402
00:06:45,120 --> 00:07:00,104
Do you live in a big house?

403
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:15,044
Ah. I see.

404
00:07:15,044 --> 00:07:30,139
That's it. It's the second week. I'm pretty sure.

405
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:45,144
But if you can't write Kotsuna, eat it in the first place. If you can't open it.

406
00:07:45,144 --> 00:08:00,143
Is there an offering somewhere?
