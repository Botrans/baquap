1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:52:02,800
It's started. Please yes. Today is 10. Gather in front.

2
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:17,787
I also practiced.

3
00:52:17,787 --> 00:52:47,812
It turned black, but my partner Mochihiro killed me almost without knowing anything, so I made it white. Please.

4
00:52:47,812 --> 00:53:02,763
I was hitting here.

5
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:32,818
I killed all of them in the practice game, so I'll do my best to be white this time. Thank you. High halo.

6
00:53:32,818 --> 00:53:47,704
I want to go.

7
00:53:47,704 --> 00:54:02,746
Ice I've never played white before.

8
00:54:02,746 --> 00:54:17,752
It might be better.

9
00:54:17,752 --> 00:54:32,764
Yes, please. Mr. Natori.

10
00:54:32,764 --> 00:54:47,750
8 When Tokiwa's Pompoko is lying. lost.

11
00:54:47,750 --> 00:55:02,702
Thank you.

12
00:55:02,702 --> 00:55:17,748
Ecchan and Ponpoko-chan carrying one stick. I'm sorry, but I don't know until I see it. Game restaurant.

13
00:55:17,748 --> 00:55:32,746
I don't have one, so please. My uncle got me done quickly.

14
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:47,758
I'm scared. Thank you.

15
00:55:47,758 --> 00:56:02,761
Who

16
00:56:02,761 --> 00:56:17,766
I live the longest.

17
00:56:17,766 --> 00:56:32,793
I'll dismantle it.

18
00:56:32,793 --> 00:57:17,761
The flowers were in bloom.

19
00:57:17,761 --> 00:57:32,742
Mochi chick who kills everyone. Give it out.

20
00:57:32,742 --> 00:57:47,781
At that time, I don't play the game aiming for the victory of the camp. There is none.

21
00:57:47,781 --> 00:58:02,802
As I say, you can win by completing each task. Then ban it. You can win.

22
00:58:02,802 --> 00:58:17,770
Kurume. However, if you kill them until they become birds, you can win.

23
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:32,770
If it's free coverage, don't leave. But is it okay? OK.

24
00:58:32,770 --> 00:59:02,787
It seems that the trick is not to read it, so I act as a group. I want to fix this.

25
00:59:02,787 --> 00:59:17,793
Don't let Robo-chan look like someone is there.

26
00:59:17,793 --> 00:59:32,748
Let's go with the baby. Somehow these two are cute with vitamin colors.

27
00:59:32,748 --> 00:59:47,749
Ka-chan, Naha-dori, and Melon-san together. Can I use aluminum? Repair.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 01:00:34,638
Was it there? I fixed it to 2. Killed a human.

29
01:00:34,638 --> 01:00:49,681
What a thing.

30
01:00:49,681 --> 01:01:04,603
killed. At that time. I don't remember here either.

31
01:01:04,603 --> 01:01:34,601
It's too early to die.

32
01:01:34,601 --> 01:02:04,618
Which one? If you come now.

33
01:02:04,618 --> 01:02:19,619
It's quiet. I still have a lot of room.

34
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:34,646
Hahahaha. It didn't start. If Hinata can use the button.

35
01:02:34,646 --> 01:02:49,552
Glitter.

36
01:02:49,552 --> 01:03:04,639
That's right. There is a bar.

37
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:19,601
It was Yama-chan.

38
01:03:19,601 --> 01:03:34,652
is that so. I was run over by a car.

39
01:03:34,652 --> 01:03:49,595
Popo-chan image. Didn't you push it?

40
01:03:49,595 --> 01:04:04,643
I just read it again.

41
01:04:04,643 --> 01:04:34,672
It's cute, really.

42
01:04:34,672 --> 01:04:49,670
Look at Ponpoko Ponpoko-chan.

43
01:04:49,670 --> 01:05:04,677
No, it 's amazing. On earth.

44
01:05:04,677 --> 01:05:49,616
I'm sorry I went to RTA now.

45
01:05:49,616 --> 01:06:04,681
It's still 15 minutes.

46
01:06:04,681 --> 01:06:19,597
I thought I would do it or touched it.

47
01:06:19,597 --> 01:06:49,631
It was early.

48
01:06:49,631 --> 01:07:04,675
Do you work at home? Yes Yes Yes. let's do our best.

49
01:07:04,675 --> 01:07:19,619
Next time, I'll try to make an item first, so seriously.

50
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:34,733
Even though I was killed, I just can't come. So someone is with me. 2 First.

51
01:07:34,733 --> 01:07:49,641
1960 OK.

52
01:07:49,641 --> 01:08:04,656
Eat this alone. Because I act as a group. It's just a little embarrassing. Scary scary Let's go together.

53
01:08:04,656 --> 01:08:19,635
There is also Deron-chan. Phone-chan.

54
01:08:19,635 --> 01:08:49,654
cafeteria. I was dead in a good place.

55
01:08:49,654 --> 01:09:04,622
I think Hina-chan should be big.

56
01:09:04,622 --> 01:09:19,599
The white eyes are peeled off. It arrives per shield.

57
01:09:19,599 --> 01:09:34,661
Ponpoko-chan went first, so tomorrow.

58
01:09:34,661 --> 01:09:49,701
I wish I had gone after seeing the ghost. Who found it? If you go together, go down two.

59
01:09:49,701 --> 01:10:04,644
Somehow green. I think so, if you say it properly in the future.

60
01:10:04,644 --> 01:10:19,652
You are the most cocktail this time. I was in the cafeteria last.

61
01:10:19,652 --> 01:10:34,643
If you can be absolutely cool in terms of distance, the two should be white.

62
01:10:34,643 --> 01:10:49,596
It's true.

63
01:10:49,596 --> 01:11:04,577
What should I do. why.

64
01:11:04,577 --> 01:11:34,707
The books of Ponpoko-san and Peanuts-kun will be released soon. Thank you everyone. There aren't many, but it's said that it's not good to go alone.

65
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:49,635
Is it a lever?

66
01:11:49,635 --> 01:12:04,639
This is electricity. Aoi-chan was fine.

67
01:12:04,639 --> 01:12:19,632
The rest of the storage I saw is these days.

68
01:12:19,632 --> 01:12:34,684
Did you find it now? flower. From the direction. I see.

69
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:49,661
While there was a power outage, I thought it was going to be a power outage after a vertical kill, so I checked for the time being.

70
01:12:49,661 --> 01:13:04,971
What are you doing now? I'm going to turn off the lights on the futon. Bed merry.

71
01:13:04,971 --> 01:13:19,657
I feel like there was another one. The lights are turned off. I remember it was there.

72
01:13:19,657 --> 01:13:34,661
You've made a mistake right now.

73
01:13:34,661 --> 01:13:49,701
From that cafeteria, take the weapon all the time. Since it was published in the storage run edition, I'm trying to cure the electricity toward the electrical.

74
01:13:49,701 --> 01:14:04,674
A timer encounter. With various people halfway.

75
01:14:04,674 --> 01:14:19,643
No. When I tried my best and went to the right side.

76
01:14:19,643 --> 01:14:34,671
For fine macho. what will you do.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 01:15:06,510
Breakthrough The current child is suspicious in color after all.

78
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:21,511
I'm suspicious, so I wonder if it's okay to catch it.

79
01:15:21,511 --> 01:15:36,521
It seemed to be a strong heart. Do not ship Mac from IC. I completely forgot about my mouth.

80
01:15:36,521 --> 01:15:51,532
There are two.

81
01:15:51,532 --> 01:16:06,550
Yeah this is the number of people left. Is this Renjaku Aoi-chan all right?

82
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:21,543
I don't.

83
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:36,582
Anyo's song. I'm scared to be alone with Pikmin. This area is a little bit at the same time.

84
01:16:36,582 --> 01:16:51,506
Located on the feet. Coin balls are strong.

85
01:16:51,506 --> 01:17:06,549
I can't press it. I don't understand what it means.

86
01:17:06,549 --> 01:17:21,543
I'll put it in welfare. Someone has fixed it.

87
01:17:21,543 --> 01:17:51,535
Bamboo cutting.

88
01:17:51,535 --> 01:18:06,533
The toilet is perfect because it must be this.

89
01:18:06,533 --> 01:18:20,487
1 minute.

90
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:36,553
I will try to shape it. Please give me wings.

91
01:18:36,553 --> 01:19:06,539
I unlocked it.

92
01:19:06,539 --> 01:19:20,467
Shall we go.

93
01:19:20,467 --> 01:19:36,549
Apparently, I had the wrong way to turn on the electricity. It's over. I couldn't do it, so I decided to do it properly this time.

94
01:19:36,549 --> 01:19:51,579
I feel like there is Anatoli. Let's go with three people.

95
01:19:51,579 --> 01:20:06,552
The next task is. Let's go with these three tomorrow. Let's go to Licca-chan Destroyer.

96
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:21,531
Yes it is good.

97
01:20:21,531 --> 01:20:36,548
Where, where, where, where. There were some pink people.

98
01:20:36,548 --> 01:21:06,542
It's urgent that two people are trying to fit one. You can't do such a stupid thing in the second consecutive.

99
01:21:06,542 --> 01:21:21,562
There is no excuse. I say.

100
01:21:21,562 --> 01:21:36,515
You.

101
01:21:36,515 --> 01:21:51,567
You guys got stuck in your head.

102
01:21:51,567 --> 01:22:06,544
Natori. Merry Christmas bird.

103
01:22:06,544 --> 01:22:21,586
I arrived at Riisa Naka 3.

104
01:22:21,586 --> 01:22:36,562
Here. I fell asleep, but Pika-chan is still in the range of group activities.

105
01:22:36,562 --> 01:23:06,546
I'm going too. Yes.

106
01:23:06,546 --> 01:23:36,568
02 Tomoyo Yes I saw it I am reporting.

107
01:23:36,568 --> 01:23:51,535
It's either of the two. It's confident.

108
01:23:51,535 --> 01:24:21,516
I saw it awesome.

109
01:24:21,516 --> 01:24:36,514
Sana Natori. Peron-chan.

110
01:24:36,514 --> 01:25:05,457
It's cool.

111
01:25:05,457 --> 01:25:20,473
cute.

112
01:25:20,473 --> 01:25:36,557
The demon is cool. This is amazing. Someone Kinpira.

113
01:25:36,557 --> 01:26:06,583
Shall we catch Roboco-san? I think it's more than that.

114
01:26:06,583 --> 01:26:21,536
What kind of route was it?

115
01:26:21,536 --> 01:26:36,563
Wherever I was.

116
01:26:36,563 --> 01:26:51,527
As expected, Robo-chan is absolutely good if you do it. I think it was. Not yet.

117
01:26:51,527 --> 01:27:06,541
You can believe it.

118
01:27:06,541 --> 01:27:21,519
Why why why After all I could see it.

119
01:27:21,519 --> 01:27:36,548
It has poop in it.

120
01:27:36,548 --> 01:28:06,527
I was tired.

121
01:28:06,527 --> 01:28:36,551
No, Natori was quick.

122
01:28:36,551 --> 01:28:51,510
I sent it, but good morning, I hope you can build it well. Should I look it up?

123
01:28:51,510 --> 01:29:06,547
After this I.

124
01:29:06,547 --> 01:29:21,539
It was my first time, but it looks like it's up to the end.

125
01:29:21,539 --> 01:29:36,542
but it's okay. Are you proceeding with black accuracy?

126
01:29:36,542 --> 01:29:51,531
To pink.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 01:30:08,624
That's fine, but apart from that. I'm thinking of going here for my goal.

128
01:30:08,624 --> 01:30:38,605
This way, this way.

129
01:30:38,605 --> 01:30:53,563
jobs. 6471. Believe that you're going home and you can do this.

130
01:30:53,563 --> 01:31:08,565
Darren Moran.

131
01:31:08,565 --> 01:31:23,625
A woman doing tasks while saying.

132
01:31:23,625 --> 01:31:38,585
Chihiro-chan of Mochihiro-chan. While thinking that Coco-chan should be okay.

133
01:31:38,585 --> 01:31:53,604
9 more times.

134
01:31:53,604 --> 01:32:08,572
Will it rain? It's pretty good.

135
01:32:08,572 --> 01:32:23,609
I found it, so I thought I'd see it together.

136
01:32:23,609 --> 01:32:38,593
It's true.

137
01:32:38,593 --> 01:33:08,606
Let's fall into the pond.

138
01:33:08,606 --> 01:33:23,520
encounter. America.

139
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:38,631
Just sleep in the comments section. I went, but I wonder if it's okay. There are many.

140
01:33:38,631 --> 01:33:53,584
Shot to do.

141
01:33:53,584 --> 01:34:08,616
Standing up, no one is there, but it's okay. Nobody, nobody.

142
01:34:08,616 --> 01:34:23,567
Where and who is.

143
01:34:23,567 --> 01:34:38,614
When I entered the room for spring, the report button came out.

144
01:34:38,614 --> 01:35:08,634
I ran from 4 to 65 and saw this Ami.

145
01:35:08,634 --> 01:35:23,597
When I entered Clash Royale, I felt like I was back because of the current power outage.

146
01:35:23,597 --> 01:35:38,612
I'm fighting with this. He said he recorded it.

147
01:35:38,612 --> 01:35:53,557
I feel like I saw Aoi-chan together.

148
01:35:53,557 --> 01:36:08,606
Tell mom.

149
01:36:08,606 --> 01:36:23,562
I don't understand.

150
01:36:23,562 --> 01:36:38,518
I don't know.

151
01:36:38,518 --> 01:36:53,592
What is it again?

152
01:36:53,592 --> 01:37:08,634
Keyboard later. I thought. I haven't seen it, so I don't know if I kill it and come back.

153
01:37:08,634 --> 01:37:23,609
The dragonfly stops.

154
01:37:23,609 --> 01:37:38,606
Would you like to do this? Everyone to drink. I'm just taking a nap, but I just noticed an error.

155
01:37:38,606 --> 01:37:53,633
A lot of men's songs Don't go everyone Don't go everyone.

156
01:37:53,633 --> 01:38:08,587
Left head I entered the left. I'm doing a task here. There are a lot of things to appeal to.

157
01:38:08,587 --> 01:38:23,620
I've got a lot of purple colors. You can only see it.

158
01:38:23,620 --> 01:38:38,598
Don't be alone. Were you there?

159
01:38:38,598 --> 01:39:08,597
admin. I didn't have a connection right now. Everyone was somewhere.

160
01:39:08,597 --> 01:39:38,608
Yeah. A good number of people. Ui-chan That-chan and Ron-chan.

161
01:39:38,608 --> 01:39:53,569
Go from the electrical to the reactor.

162
01:39:53,569 --> 01:40:08,570
On the way home with a kappa engine. Hohohohoho.

163
01:40:08,570 --> 01:40:23,553
After going to the electrical, I went to a cafe.

164
01:40:23,553 --> 01:40:38,578
I managed to put it in and went in together. When I returned, I entered my father.

165
01:40:38,578 --> 01:40:53,603
Personally, Aoi-chan and no one are waiting.

166
01:40:53,603 --> 01:41:08,624
After Yoktone, it's about security.

167
01:41:08,624 --> 01:41:38,613
Who died? I don't understand the sand at all at that time.

168
01:41:38,613 --> 01:41:53,568
No, we were together a while ago, but we are connected.

169
01:41:53,568 --> 01:42:08,579
It's dangerous, maybe. Daddy 03.

170
01:42:08,579 --> 01:42:23,567
I'm a little scared. Chechecheche. No one is here.

171
01:42:23,567 --> 01:42:38,585
There is Ao-chan.

172
01:42:38,585 --> 01:43:08,625
Both came from the door, but I haven't seen him here.

173
01:43:08,625 --> 01:43:23,598
Aoi-chan cuts it at all. I don't think so.

174
01:43:23,598 --> 01:43:38,602
Then I said I'd cure it with a reactor. Not on the street.

175
01:43:38,602 --> 01:43:53,579
Anpanman. I was wondering if there was something really sharp.

176
01:43:53,579 --> 01:44:08,571
Because he keeps an eye on me. Where were you?

177
01:44:08,571 --> 01:44:23,578
Is it okay because that person appeared ikebo? No one was killed. The reactor has become.

178
01:44:23,578 --> 01:44:38,609
Not suitable for reactors from shields.

179
01:44:38,609 --> 01:44:53,646
I really don't need it. I stopped the real thing and the reactor together, but I didn't stop.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 01:45:10,619
It's a little suspicious that it wasn't close.

181
01:45:10,619 --> 01:45:25,620
Oh yeah. Stop the pulse and deliver to home. Reactor Don't write it down.

182
01:45:25,620 --> 01:45:40,593
I will follow you. Kiyose.

183
01:45:40,593 --> 01:45:55,635
I'm thinking of following the birds. Pikmin-chan, maybe. Isn't it okay? I feel like it's soup stock.

184
01:45:55,635 --> 01:46:10,643
Because I'm watching. From tomorrow to tomorrow.

185
01:46:10,643 --> 01:46:25,550
tits.

186
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:55,602
You were hiding in the event.

187
01:46:55,602 --> 01:47:10,621
What is the timing of killing?

188
01:47:10,621 --> 01:47:25,641
It was early. Make me cramp.

189
01:47:25,641 --> 01:47:40,649
Hey, there's no one to call that.

190
01:47:40,649 --> 01:47:55,597
A warm guy.

191
01:47:55,597 --> 01:48:25,654
How many people are there now? To get out of the house.

192
01:48:25,654 --> 01:48:40,656
I was killed in front of me. Would you like to rebuild it?

193
01:48:40,656 --> 01:49:10,642
Then there is a penalty. not yet.

194
01:49:10,642 --> 01:49:25,601
I'm being threatened.

195
01:49:25,601 --> 01:49:40,557
I don't know anything.

196
01:49:40,557 --> 01:50:25,612
I don't know how to do it.

197
01:50:25,612 --> 01:50:40,555
What should I do.

198
01:50:40,555 --> 01:50:55,619
Aoi-chan. I think it's not good to join them properly.

199
01:50:55,619 --> 01:51:10,608
Why is there no one? It's Arima tomorrow, though this is 1000 yen. Stupid with me.

200
01:51:10,608 --> 01:51:25,657
You saw it now. Become.

201
01:51:25,657 --> 01:51:40,571
talent.

202
01:51:40,571 --> 01:51:55,558
With two people.

203
01:51:55,558 --> 01:52:10,563
I see.

204
01:52:10,563 --> 01:52:25,629
I ran away. It's definitely fast. Ueno store of the current storage.

205
01:52:25,629 --> 01:52:40,664
With Mocchan and Sara. I think it's the latest crime.

206
01:52:40,664 --> 01:52:55,615
It's really cheap.

207
01:52:55,615 --> 01:53:10,640
Mate tea has a little memory, so put it in the sky.

208
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:25,625
I haven't seen another opportunity.

209
01:53:25,625 --> 01:53:40,668
Everyone's city in admin. I felt like I was alone in that electrical, so I was alone to go.

210
01:53:40,668 --> 01:54:10,637
Is it that hair? It's really cheap though.

211
01:54:10,637 --> 01:54:25,649
Hello with a roller.

212
01:54:25,649 --> 01:54:40,684
No, I rub the man 3 to do without killing it. What should i do? What should I do?

213
01:54:40,684 --> 01:54:55,603
What should I do? If you follow 3 more people, 3 people.

214
01:54:55,603 --> 01:55:10,642
Shall we consider whether to take care of him? I didn't do anything, I just saw them and killed them.

215
01:55:10,642 --> 01:55:25,659
Ask me anything.

216
01:55:25,659 --> 01:55:40,647
The feelings of the person you like.

217
01:55:40,647 --> 01:55:55,584
So there. 8.

218
01:55:55,584 --> 01:56:10,665
It's really dangerous to have two young people.

219
01:56:10,665 --> 01:56:25,605
Even Arora should feel like eating when it's over. I'll try a roller. I catch a pompoko.

220
01:56:25,605 --> 01:56:40,683
Fishing with insurance. If you don't finish with a delicious omelet, mommy.

221
01:56:40,683 --> 01:56:55,630
I don't know.

222
01:56:55,630 --> 01:57:10,620
Take a look. Ah together. Will you miss it?

223
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:25,617
Let's go together. Because Popo-chan.

224
01:57:25,617 --> 01:57:40,627
If Moko-chan is killed, I will. So protect each other.

225
01:57:40,627 --> 01:57:55,651
Mochi Hiyo-chan. I have to wake it up.

226
01:57:55,651 --> 01:58:10,647
Do you pretend to be doing something? Then I'm alone. Tucky.

227
01:58:10,647 --> 01:58:25,611
If that Hinata-chan was killed a while ago, it would be a pompon.

228
01:58:25,611 --> 01:58:40,641
nap. I wonder if it can't be used for a while after sabotage.

229
01:58:40,641 --> 01:58:55,584
It's too close when I try it.

230
01:58:55,584 --> 01:59:10,668
There are too many people who are dangerous. That's not true. I wonder if it will snow from now on.

231
01:59:10,668 --> 01:59:25,632
Everyone isn't on the left. I think who should be killed.

232
01:59:25,632 --> 01:59:40,678
952. I want to kill someone, but what should I do with this?

233
01:59:40,678 --> 01:59:55,620
Do you want to do it a little? the same.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 02:00:12,611
That's what Aoi-chan is doing.

235
02:00:12,611 --> 02:00:27,635
I thought I'd roll it up, but there's a chicken. Turn off the toilet lights.

236
02:00:27,635 --> 02:00:42,602
I went there right away. I have a lot now, so on the contrary, this is now.

237
02:00:42,602 --> 02:00:57,637
No wonder it's suspicious. Licca-chan is a cute pajamas.

238
02:00:57,637 --> 02:01:12,664
No, kill now Chika-chan, kill now.

239
02:01:12,664 --> 02:01:27,603
It's not good, Sana-chan.

240
02:01:27,603 --> 02:01:42,662
I wonder if my husband has been killed round and round. I have something to say.

241
02:01:42,662 --> 02:01:57,641
Once I made a house, the color was when it got stuck on the right side of the engine.

242
02:01:57,641 --> 02:02:12,680
I was scared, so I was trying to get Hinata to protect me.

243
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:42,638
It's over I'm done too. You may want to see it someday.

244
02:02:42,638 --> 02:02:57,606
Marathon gymnastics.

245
02:02:57,606 --> 02:03:12,594
Even with this, take one person. Aoi-chan is Ai-chan Ai-chan.

246
02:03:12,594 --> 02:03:27,677
I've never killed me so I want to kill someone. Steiner.

247
02:03:27,677 --> 02:03:42,615
LINE de-chan. I don't want to see that.

248
02:03:42,615 --> 02:03:57,590
It's not like shiny. Alright.

249
02:03:57,590 --> 02:05:27,595
I thought I'd make you suffer.

250
02:05:27,595 --> 02:05:42,590
I got it.

251
02:05:42,590 --> 02:06:12,642
It's impossible, though. Easy and cute. After all I deserve it.

252
02:06:12,642 --> 02:06:27,584
For the time being.

253
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:42,620
Hinata-chan Dog Ne Hinata-chan Let's go together. now. I think you can trust it. There are many.

254
02:06:42,620 --> 02:06:57,668
It's dangerous to do a task alone while the lights are off. Thank you.

255
02:06:57,668 --> 02:07:12,649
I can't remember.

256
02:07:12,649 --> 02:07:27,623
I want to do a pass, so let's go here. I'm next to you right now.

257
02:07:27,623 --> 02:07:42,603
There are so many things, so let's do it now.

258
02:07:42,603 --> 02:07:57,694
You're watching Robo-chan.

259
02:07:57,694 --> 02:08:12,662
Not a god. Both flew.

260
02:08:12,662 --> 02:08:27,592
Impostor.

261
02:08:27,592 --> 02:08:42,633
Thank you for doing that. The best.

262
02:08:42,633 --> 02:08:57,618
I don't take Natori. pushed.

263
02:08:57,618 --> 02:09:27,625
The task is over. I thought I should go.

264
02:09:27,625 --> 02:09:42,623
What are you doing? I don't know if it's white or black, but if possible, I'm a good mom.

265
02:09:42,623 --> 02:09:57,570
By all means.

266
02:09:57,570 --> 02:10:12,651
On the contrary, if Chihiro Samu did black.

267
02:10:12,651 --> 02:10:27,623
I said the task was over, so let's go together. I'll do it.

268
02:10:27,623 --> 02:10:42,636
Who is next? map.

269
02:10:42,636 --> 02:10:57,571
There are.

270
02:10:57,571 --> 02:11:12,540
Ueno.

271
02:11:12,540 --> 02:11:27,647
Good woman guy.

272
02:11:27,647 --> 02:11:42,604
Shall we do without OK? 670. Big motor.

273
02:11:42,604 --> 02:11:57,645
Will you come Mochi Hiyo-chan I often fish with that master. It's the best.

274
02:11:57,645 --> 02:12:12,660
Someone in the morning is dead and metamorphosis is okay.

275
02:12:12,660 --> 02:12:42,589
I killed Enoden and didn't have any money.

276
02:12:42,589 --> 02:12:57,590
With a man.

277
02:12:57,590 --> 02:13:12,630
If you don't drink it, it's dangerous.

278
02:13:12,630 --> 02:13:27,642
I haven't seen the corpse, so it's not like that.

279
02:13:27,642 --> 02:13:42,637
There is also a short festival. I didn't see it either. Adventure.

280
02:13:42,637 --> 02:13:57,583
I'm killed.

281
02:13:57,583 --> 02:14:12,629
The previous stance. That's why I want to fish alone. I want to do it.

282
02:14:12,629 --> 02:14:27,610
Yes, I don't know.

283
02:14:27,610 --> 02:14:42,648
It's white because it's far from that if you use it for a crying attitude. Because it's a cafeteria guy.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 02:15:14,576
Something.

285
02:15:14,576 --> 02:15:29,652
These three people are really cheap. Can we go with these four people?

286
02:15:29,652 --> 02:15:44,621
I think it's good. Yu Ito.

287
02:15:44,621 --> 02:15:59,658
Four people are fine. Is it over?

288
02:15:59,658 --> 02:16:14,620
It looks like a lie.

289
02:16:14,620 --> 02:16:29,644
Did you do it today? I thought it was dangerous.

290
02:16:29,644 --> 02:16:44,624
It wasn't frozen yet. Who is over and I am over.

291
02:16:44,624 --> 02:16:59,648
I didn't feel like going to a task at all. Punilite fish.

292
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:29,676
Always act together and enter the poster club as a good friend.

293
02:17:29,676 --> 02:17:59,703
This honest hairstyle from the beginning with a sense of speed and the end.

294
02:17:59,703 --> 02:18:14,712
I don't feel like I understand it.

295
02:18:14,712 --> 02:18:29,634
From above. vtuber.

296
02:18:29,634 --> 02:18:44,662
I'm glad that this member will come out with something. I don't have any special promotion for the guardian spirit.

297
02:18:44,662 --> 02:18:59,665
I really think.

298
02:18:59,665 --> 02:19:14,671
I made a mistake, but how many days did it end up? Ponga Ponga will appear.

299
02:19:14,671 --> 02:19:29,658
Congratulations on your new model. It's cold today.

300
02:19:29,658 --> 02:19:44,661
Why did you get a face because it's hot. In February, there will be a live performance of all songs called Bloom.

301
02:19:44,661 --> 02:19:59,675
There is nothing in 8 in particular.

302
02:19:59,675 --> 02:20:14,637
Natori is on March 7th. That's why Netsuke is on sale and there will be various outing videos tomorrow.

303
02:20:14,637 --> 02:20:29,682
The original song will be released on February 1st at 0:00. Thank you, let's do it again.

304
02:20:29,682 --> 02:20:44,640
I'm back home, so I'm just across the street.

305
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:59,668
Thank you very much. Let's go with the feeling of tightening with an Ehime capsule.

306
02:20:59,668 --> 02:21:14,672
I think I'll talk lightly.

307
02:21:14,672 --> 02:21:29,701
Browsing comment section Thank you everyone. It's a difficult cat game.

308
02:21:29,701 --> 02:21:44,667
No, I'm the opposite, I'm a wolf. It's a lot of annoyance. This was difficult.

309
02:21:44,667 --> 02:21:59,627
Let's not put it on. No, no.

310
02:21:59,627 --> 02:22:14,698
Peace of mind and sex as usual. I've never turned black. I wonder if it's the first black.

311
02:22:14,698 --> 02:22:29,657
It was a convincing part. I'm sad. After all, you know, you lose without killing anyone.

312
02:22:29,657 --> 02:22:44,636
I killed only the Megohime song, maybe Pompoko-san.

313
02:22:44,636 --> 02:22:59,627
It 's about me. I think I'll stand in front of the task.

314
02:22:59,627 --> 02:23:14,669
So this time. I hope I can do something on this bench again tomorrow. I woke up now.

315
02:23:14,669 --> 02:23:29,634
It's your own personal announcement.

316
02:23:29,634 --> 02:23:44,687
It's a little unusual because the collaboration delivery was given to the collision. It's rare to do it, so please take a look. Yes, today is a cat.

317
02:23:44,687 --> 02:23:59,669
Thank you bye bye. Bye bye.

318
02:23:59,669 --> 02:24:14,583
Bye bye.

319
02:24:14,583 --> 02:24:29,602
Bye bye.
