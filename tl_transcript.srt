It was hung. thought so. You'll get burned.

61
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:30,098
It would be bad to put soil next to the magma.

62
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:45,153
I'd like to plant flowers in Shun Oguri. That was really good. I got only one rose sapling, so I should pay it.

63
00:03:45,153 --> 00:04:00,104
Kuchu sound. I'm sorry I couldn't find two if I got used to it.

00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:45,118
There is a jungle tree, but that was a long time ago.

67
00:04:45,118 --> 00:05:00,134
I found cacao seeds there for the first time, so I put cacao on the jungle tree of the umbrella. I wasn't sure why I was using it, so I bought a flower.

68
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:15,162
You've picked up the jungle saplings again. I want to make it a jungle here.

69
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:30,178
Then it's 5 o'clock I want it again. Either one sees from the open-air bath. Great.

70
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:45,146
The sound is for everyone. Cop'n car.

71
00:05:45,146 --> 00:06:00,143
It's perfect because I was taught. The name is the best, how did you do it?

72
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:30,124
I'll open a cacao plantation here.

73
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:45,138
I'm sure this is a wonderful green spread.

74
00:06:45,138 --> 00:07:00,110
Not really.

75
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:15,104
Seen from the outside, it looks unexpectedly bad. It's wonderful.

76
00:07:15,104 --> 00:07:30,117
What are you doing? I wonder if I can go to Japan.

77
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:45,078
Let's go here here.

78
00:07:45,078 --> 00:08:00,100
Jungle seedlings. It's already good. Hey.

79
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:15,092
I wanted to make it a single pine tree. Green is wonderful.

80
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:30,113
The baby watching the horror is also watching.

81
00:08:30,113 --> 00:08:45,133
I wonder if my heart is dirty.

82
00:08:45,133 --> 00:09:00,086
What is this? I'm not saying it anyway.

83
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:15,141
It's a stumbling block that looks like a liar Armstrong gun. I didn't mean that.

84
00:09:15,141 --> 00:09:30,136
That's good. I noticed that. I'm glad it was dangerous green green It's really different.

85
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:45,083
But something is already here. Everyone wants it.

86
00:09:45,083 --> 00:10:00,120
It can't be helped. Open the gimmick.

87
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:15,133
Hey everyone, really sloppy, really everyone.

88
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:30,090
There are 5 minutes left.

89
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:45,042
A little.

90
00:10:45,042 --> 00:11:15,057
thus.

91
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:30,121
I was told that I would like to expect Yuka Yuka from my sister, so Nene will clear the floor.

92
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:45,057
It's amazing.

93
00:11:45,057 --> 00:12:00,147
I wonder if I can incorporate it into my room. I wonder if I will incorporate it. It's really cool.

94
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:15,116
Shun Oguri's Soma.

95
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:30,108
Really wonderful. What should I do suddenly?

96
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:45,096
now. It's sticking out.

97
00:12:45,096 --> 00:13:00,096
That turtle is a wish. I will make it a nether block. And I think it's more beautiful.

98
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:15,125
It's because of the wall. It's because the snow blocks are buried around here.

99
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:30,106
game. If this doesn't come out, I'll be invited to bring it.

100
00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:45,126
57 minutes 3 minutes left 3 minutes left.

101
00:13:45,126 --> 00:14:00,098
I'm coming home. Hey, don't play in the snow.

102
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:30,122
I want to take a questionnaire at the end. People who slide from this wall or Nether for treatment. Finally. Glass.

103
00:14:30,122 --> 00:14:45,152
By the way, in 9 days, that transparent glass, or it's banned or pink and light blue.

104
00:14:45,152 --> 00:15:00,113
Colored glass. It's too early. So that's it. Okay, thank you everyone for the cat.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,112
Thank you and you enjoyed it.

106
00:00:15,112 --> 00:00:30,159
I wonder if it's a job. Senior Flair A big charter following seniors. I can't stop being surprised. Next, I would like to touch the baton.

107
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:45,100
Let's go play I'll do my best to reach the goal soon. Well then.
