1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:00,143
Your home. I'm curious about that.

2
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:30,141
Comment Nice wait, I haven't done anything, I've eaten ramen with Imayuki.

3
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:45,109
Wait, you're really hungry, right? I'm really sleepy lately, why?

4
00:02:45,109 --> 00:03:00,053
ramen.

5
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:15,130
Suzuran no Yu.

6
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:30,152
I ate it, but today the song is coming, so a little.

7
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:45,116
If it grows, it's inside the car. Yoshimune is running low, so it's okay.

8
00:03:45,116 --> 00:04:00,148
Later that today.

9
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:15,139
I'm just ready to think that it's really different. I couldn't do it in front of me.

10
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:30,100
It was good, isn't it? That project will be included, so for now. So a little.

11
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:45,141
It's a little because Sunday's song may not come to sleep. I'm working now. Carmina Eco is included properly. Drink water.

12
00:04:45,141 --> 00:05:00,116
today. Papico. Yeah.

13
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:15,139
Let's sing the kindergarten.

14
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:30,131
Just because it's midnight today. That's not the case. See ya.

15
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:45,174
Excite Notepad Why did you sleep so much Why do you think you sleep so much? you know what. I feel like I've been sleeping all the time.

16
00:05:45,174 --> 00:06:00,134
I'll sleep all the time and it will snow. Yeah. After all it is a building without cake.

17
00:06:00,134 --> 00:06:15,120
Seikima ii I thought there was snow.

18
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:30,130
I wonder if my body is looking for hibernation because it's cold. I'm looking for. It seems likely.

19
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:45,108
Because it 's this. Without saying. Only.

20
00:06:45,108 --> 00:07:00,171
I think. And a new Armored Core work will be released. I really like it. The body seeks a struggle. The body is far away.

21
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:30,063
Please wait.

22
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:45,132
Even though I was sick. There is no sound source for the sound of Dadeumi.

23
00:07:45,132 --> 00:08:00,115
Sound source for Anpanman.

24
00:08:00,115 --> 00:08:15,111
A popular summer song.

25
00:08:15,111 --> 00:09:15,137
You can't balance it in half.

26
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:30,129
Please give me one tense feeling.

27
00:09:30,129 --> 00:10:00,101
Misato Masaki. It almost disappears in good health.

28
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:15,095
Please use the lowest mobile phone ever.

29
00:10:15,095 --> 00:10:30,122
A request to you One tense feeling.

30
00:10:30,122 --> 00:11:00,098
It's not embarrassing or anything like that. Stop from now on.

31
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:15,137
I'm not shy, but I'm cursed King Provided King. It's not so stop.

32
00:11:15,137 --> 00:11:30,101
Sound game with recent sound songs. Voice out. Is it just anison?

33
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:45,109
Anison's j-pop. I'm going. I was able to do it.

34
00:11:45,109 --> 00:12:15,149
Level five. 8 years old.

35
00:12:15,149 --> 00:13:00,095
When it exceeds.

36
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:30,175
As a gokaiger, when I recall it in the future, the true meaning of strength is to accept the pain as it is, which I have been searching for. The scenery that goes down is flowing to you who keeps running.

37
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:45,154
Feel the sell signal with your body.

38
00:13:45,154 --> 00:14:00,129
Look without looking away from the truth that you unravel.

39
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:15,098
I felt a lot of roads When did you run on your back I feel so close.

40
00:14:15,098 --> 00:14:30,183
Looking up at the sky approaching Friends I'll overcome my hurt memory someday My longing is power. Because there is something I want to protect. Run up to the scenery.

41
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:45,128
YouTube never withers.

42
00:14:45,128 --> 00:15:00,126
Memories to eat.

43
00:15:00,126 --> 00:15:15,139
The difference in the light of the beginning.

44
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:30,141
I was afraid to judge. To drown. The scenery that goes around is flowing now. The destination of the world.

45
00:15:30,141 --> 00:16:00,163
Believe in power.

46
00:16:00,163 --> 00:16:45,107

95
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:15,161
Everyone had a rap part, surely on that day. Abacus. Kotori-chan is the one at the center.

96
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:30,097
It wasn't it, it's the Blueberry Train. It was nostalgic.

97
00:13:30,097 --> 00:13:45,190
No, I don't remember at all. It was a lesson. It's hard, is not it.

98
00:13:45,190 --> 00:14:00,153
I was diagnosed with that Kotori, but that was that hat. I'm about to miss an airplane or something. I'm sure.

Is it a place? This is now. Really wait, really wait a minute, only Anison is singing.

107
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:15,156
I was thinking about it. It 's really good. Only this bar phrase is really good.

108
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:30,109
I was together.

109
00:16:30,109 --> 00:16:45,100

Where are you? Dried flower.

115
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:45,147
It's not a dry onion.

116
00:18:45,147 --> 00:19:00,150
Maybe it doesn't have to be me. I'm sorry I just quarreled when I noticed.

117
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:15,160
Curry line hairs alone, just talk to you Star 2. From here.

118

After you sleep. All all.

119
00:19:45,102 --> 00:20:00,172
It looks like a dried flower.

120
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:30,157
Maybe I'm glad I wasn't you, I won't be crying anymore, and I wish I had a long word.

121
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:45,133
Can I go now? Along with new people I wonder if you are doing well.

122
00:20:00,172 --> 00:21:00,123
Please don't follow me.

123
00:20:00,172 --> 00:21:15,089
But it's a little strange that I can't ignore it.

124
00:20:00,172 --> 00:21:30,094
I'm sure over time.

125
00:20:00,172 --> 00:22:00,163

134
00:24:15,108 --> 00:24:30,168

135
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:45,139
It's not this song, yeah yeah yeah yeah it's no good because it's a Tok song that goes, right? I know that. I'm sorry I'm sorry about the sea.

136
00:24:45,139 --> 00:25:00,131
It's a popular song. If you are young, you should see tiktok. I don't have it. Yuri-san's song because I'm not a young man.

137
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:15,140
