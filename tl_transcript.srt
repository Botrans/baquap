What is a farmer's shop? Doraemon.

4
00:02:15,165 --> 00:02:30,145
I don't have a phone book right now. Maybe this is all.

5
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:45,043
Nintama Rantaro.

6
00:02:45,043 --> 00:03:00,106
There are times when I go back to heaven, but I can now put it out.

7
00:03:00,106 --> 00:03:15,096
Hey mom thank you.

8
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:30,113

Gorilla chicks. Today is Mario Kart Adult.

10
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:15,122
I feel like I hate Mario Kart.

11
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:30,109
Thank you mom for writing this song.

12
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:45,109
How many times Mario Kart is on the 11th. Hey, withered voice, go back to the original.

13
00:04:45,109 --> 00:05:00,092
Was good. Mr. Sami Shinbo.

14
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:15,145
Thank you so much for coming to my throat.

15
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:30,121
You're done with your work.

16
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:45,122
Even though I died in the rain outside, it's a mess.

17
00:05:45,122 --> 00:06:00,116
I bought a chocolate backtrack. The voice of overseas Chinese is quite good.

18
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:15,140
The voice is coming back. Oyama Kamata. What were you doing

19
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:30,135

This is not a common cold. Tanemaji Salon, not a cold.

24
00:07:30,198 --> 00:07:45,108
The voice has withered.

25
00:07:45,108 --> 00:08:00,093
It's like coming to your voice.

26
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:15,144
The voice changed when I filled it up in the Mario Kart tournament.

27
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:30,117
I thought I'd do my best for a while, so it seems like it's coming.

28
00:08:30,117 --> 00:09:15,087
It came out in my throat.

29
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:30,122
Oh my god, but my voice has been sore for a few months that I couldn't sleep. Drinking Kampo and sleeping baby I think I can fix it with Kampo.

30
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:45,136
I can't reply and I'm not worried or stressed.

31
00:09:45,136 --> 00:10:00,123
It was the pressure of my heart.

32
00:10:00,123 --> 00:10:15,138
It doesn't improve at all.

33
00:10:15,138 --> 00:10:30,125

Start drinking it. Now it's a heart-warming Yamashita Hangekobokuto.

42
00:12:45,152 --> 00:13:00,097
He is actually too much.

43
00:13:00,097 --> 00:13:15,122
Drink a kitten camp.

44
00:13:15,122 --> 00:13:30,080
by the way. I lived as usual.

45
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:45,106
Hangekobokuto.

46
00:13:45,106 --> 00:14:15,134
Because I can't make a voice, on the contrary, it becomes stressful.

47
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:30,108
I can't make a voice because it causes a lot of stress. That's true. I saw something healed.

48
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:45,138
I don't care about the negative spiral of 6. That's it.

49
00:14:45,138 --> 00:15:00,142
I was watching the net.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,167
Chinchillas, parakeets, Java sparrows, hamsters, etc. At that time, I watched 2 videos.

Hateruma, but I'm afraid of pronunciation, so I haven't stopped.

57
00:02:30,104 --> 00:02:45,116
It's a cute and heartwarming hamster, isn't it?

58
00:02:45,116 --> 00:03:00,077
But I got a notification from 47.

59
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:30,144
The reason why I became a serious face.

60
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:45,134
I went out with my mom. The sound of flowers.

61
00:03:45,134 --> 00:04:30,152

00:08:00,118 --> 00:08:15,114
I thought I wouldn't watch YouTube.

73
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:30,098
Because there is a possibility.

74
00:08:30,098 --> 00:09:00,111
I don't know what's going on.

75
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:30,127
Why is that the man who was dying?

76
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:45,111
This Night.

77
00:09:45,111 --> 00:10:15,122

101
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:30,186
Look forward to it. That's why it's still a little too much to talk about for a long time.

102
00:02:30,186 --> 00:02:45,088
I'm going to get used to it little by little.

103
00:02:45,088 --> 00:03:00,143

It's like spring beyond the wind of Belluna.

106
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:45,151
