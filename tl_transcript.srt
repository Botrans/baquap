1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:40:53,191
I'm not true.

2
00:40:53,191 --> 00:41:08,200
I suppressed it.

3
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:23,181
It's listed.

4
00:41:23,181 --> 00:42:53,188
I'm Kaede Higuchi. Today we met 15 minutes ago.

5
00:42:53,188 --> 00:43:38,219
I just practiced and it turned black, but before I knew anything, my partner Mochihiro was almost there. Is there no whereabouts?

6
00:43:38,219 --> 00:44:08,149
I can't lie.

7
00:44:08,149 --> 00:44:23,222
Yokone I killed everyone in the Edosaki practice game, so I'll do my best to be white this time.

8
00:44:23,222 --> 00:44:38,176
I'd like to take a sigh. cute.

9
00:44:38,176 --> 00:45:08,219
I've never played it before. It might be better.

10
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:38,215
Good morning, Mr. Natori. When I played the test play at my house, it was Pompoko. Tell me to guide 10 and fish.

11
00:45:38,215 --> 00:45:53,246
He's a superman of Puzzle & Dragon Cross. I look forward to working with you. Confirmed.

12
00:45:53,246 --> 00:46:08,124
Sorry.

13
00:46:08,124 --> 00:46:23,215
I will not live, so please. Mochi-chan just did it quickly.

14
00:46:23,215 --> 00:46:38,120
I'm scared.

15
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:53,137
Who.

16
00:46:53,137 --> 00:47:23,191
I'm dismantling it.

17
00:47:23,191 --> 00:47:53,171
Can I fix it?

18
00:47:53,171 --> 00:48:23,209
Give it out.

19
00:48:23,209 --> 00:48:38,196
Even though it's a poster, I'm going to play a game aiming for the victory of that child camp.

20
00:48:38,196 --> 00:48:53,203
Does not have male abilities. When he finishes all the tasks.

21
00:48:53,203 --> 00:49:08,210
If you report it, you can win if you expel it. You can win if you kill until you become two people.

22
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:23,134
I was surprised.

23
00:49:23,134 --> 00:50:08,195
I was killed, but if it's okay so far, that person. Do not reduce the number of people.

24
00:50:08,195 --> 00:50:38,224
I put it in a lot. I'm scared. Stop it.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:51:25,111
Why did you kill

26
00:51:25,111 --> 00:51:40,110
It was a moment when I fell in love with vinegar.

27
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:55,120
Go with Hina-chan. I don't know which one died, but one is a god, isn't it? My sister remembers that direction as well.

28
00:51:55,120 --> 00:52:10,107
But I got fat. Either one won't come true. From Okanomiya.

29
00:52:10,107 --> 00:52:25,094
Ah, that's it. What was released? It's quiet, isn't it?

30
00:52:25,094 --> 00:52:40,016
But.

31
00:52:40,016 --> 00:52:55,087
I swear I wonder if it's Hana-chan.

32
00:52:55,087 --> 00:53:10,068
But it seems that there is still plenty of room for two people to use the rollers.

33
00:53:10,068 --> 00:53:25,102
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Hinata-chan is the button.

34
00:53:25,102 --> 00:53:55,071
Sana has died.

35
00:53:55,071 --> 00:54:10,099
It's really amazing. Various people were killed.

36
00:54:10,099 --> 00:54:25,105
Water brought me today I feel like that today. Only the baby went there.

37
00:54:25,105 --> 00:54:40,087
Oops Oops. Shall I get off the baby?

38
00:54:40,087 --> 00:55:10,061
Picture book Kiritani Festival.

39
00:55:10,061 --> 00:55:25,123
Really. Cabbage snacks.

40
00:55:25,123 --> 00:55:40,158
I don't know who, who, Ponpoko, Ponpoko-chan, I haven't seen it, I haven't seen it.

41
00:55:40,158 --> 00:55:55,128
I remember in the world Mochi-chan It's so white today I want to do it.

42
00:55:55,128 --> 00:56:40,108
I wonder if I went to rpa.

43
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:55,097
I can't put it into words. So I. Good good.

44
00:56:55,097 --> 00:57:10,084
So I was a little upset. I thought I would do it.

45
00:57:10,084 --> 00:57:25,107
And maybe Ao-chan. Come out too.

46
00:57:25,107 --> 00:57:40,137
Because I said Google.

47
00:57:40,137 --> 00:57:55,059
I am a parent and child.

48
00:57:55,059 --> 00:58:10,047
Bye bye. That's why I will go.

49
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:25,127
By the way, it's today's ghost chat method, but I have to talk about it. The method is different.

50
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:40,105
What should I say? What should I say?

51
00:58:40,105 --> 00:58:55,149
Everyone is there. So comment out. You can talk normally. Did you notice it because it is muted?

52
00:58:55,149 --> 00:59:10,083
It's okay to be killed by a baby and hit the head. Hiragana is lost.

53
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:25,110
There is a sign of fish. Where are all the tomatoes now? Towards the house.

54
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:40,133
I was dead when the map didn't come out, so I'm waiting or increasing.

55
00:59:40,133 --> 00:59:55,113
Hinata-chan in Otsu. Until today, I think Kushiro is fine. I headed from Naruo to Otsu. Take a nap in Tokyo.

56
00:59:55,113 --> 01:00:10,075
I think it's because it was made in Tokyo, but who feels like it?

57
01:00:10,075 --> 01:00:25,108
I was heading down because he did it. I wish I had gone after seeing the ghost.

58
01:00:25,108 --> 01:00:40,106
Hina Goto was on face 2. If you go on a date, go down two places.

59
01:00:40,106 --> 01:00:55,139
It's a shower, I think it feels like it's been fanned by the green color.

60
01:00:55,139 --> 01:01:10,078
I don't know who I am. But this time.

61
01:01:10,078 --> 01:01:25,063
Son-chan and Aoi-chan Aoi-chan was there. I went for the time being.

62
01:01:25,063 --> 01:01:40,066
LaLaport. It was around Otsu.

63
01:01:40,066 --> 01:01:55,021
I wonder if it is true.

64
01:01:55,021 --> 01:02:25,136
I wish I had done a little research. I was surprised that I was doing that report. Hey, I'm scared. I feel like Aoi-chan.

65
01:02:25,136 --> 01:02:40,078
That's what Hinata-chan isn't there.

66
01:02:40,078 --> 01:02:55,060
pizza.

67
01:02:55,060 --> 01:03:10,077
Of the trash can under the storage.

68
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:25,095
Midori was dead at 5. From the right towards the shield.

69
01:03:25,095 --> 01:03:40,111
There was green on the TV, but I thought it was going to go out after the power outage.

70
01:03:40,111 --> 01:03:55,115
I'll give you a little sound. What are you doing now? Turn off the wrinkles. I dropped it, but I accidentally went to bed.

71
01:03:55,115 --> 01:04:10,099
I remember being in the upper left of the cafeteria and disappearing after the lights were turned off. Maybe it was.

72
01:04:10,099 --> 01:04:25,121
I made a mistake. Turn up the volume.

73
01:04:25,121 --> 01:04:40,112
Communication and storage are all right.

74
01:04:40,112 --> 01:04:55,103
What did the navigation guys say?

75
01:04:55,103 --> 01:05:10,106
Because I was in line with my brother Blue. The story is different.

76
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:25,128
I was helping each other, but I wonder if I was with such a child and Aoi-chan. I remember hearing it somewhere.

77
01:05:25,128 --> 01:05:40,107
I don't like it.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 01:06:00,694
Erotic videos. Delivery.

79
01:06:00,694 --> 01:06:15,778
If it's just one step away, everyone should appear more.

80
01:06:15,778 --> 01:06:30,681
Don't lose Don't lose.

81
01:06:30,681 --> 01:06:45,738
That's right. If it is Toyota Noah, it is better to put it in another person.

82
01:06:45,738 --> 01:07:00,698
What is it made of? PC watts.

83
01:07:00,698 --> 01:07:15,713
This is a lifelong power outage. With steadily.

84
01:07:15,713 --> 01:07:30,699
Um, it's so terrifying that I'm sad.

85
01:07:30,699 --> 01:07:45,717
Hina-chan's. I'm not on the left side.

86
01:07:45,717 --> 01:08:00,747
It doesn't look like the person saying it. It doesn't come out. It's made up of spoilers.

87
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:15,710
Is this Ella Aoi-chan? Where are you.

88
01:08:15,710 --> 01:09:00,668
I got it.

89
01:09:00,668 --> 01:09:30,719
If it's not the same times.

90
01:09:30,719 --> 01:10:15,655
Absolutely.

91
01:10:15,655 --> 01:10:30,712
Satori-chan.

92
01:10:30,712 --> 01:11:15,695
nice. You can say this.

93
01:11:15,695 --> 01:11:45,716
Is it communication?

94
01:11:45,716 --> 01:12:00,744
I'm trying to fit one person together. Everyone as a god doesn't just do such stupid things.

95
01:12:00,744 --> 01:12:15,738
There is no visitation fever when it hangs down.

96
01:12:15,738 --> 01:12:45,692
I don't know where he died.

97
01:12:45,692 --> 01:13:30,712
Believe me absolutely.

98
01:13:30,712 --> 01:14:00,691
Was it okay?

99
01:14:00,691 --> 01:14:30,724
Ui mom. 032 Tomoyo Yes I saw it.

100
01:14:30,724 --> 01:14:45,694
Yatabe-chan is talkative. It's either of the two. After that I'm a little nice, right? Yes.

101
01:14:45,694 --> 01:15:00,734
I see. Is it enough at worst? Do you want to roller?

102
01:15:00,734 --> 01:15:15,696
What am I?

103
01:15:15,696 --> 01:15:30,711
I'm sorry if I did it.

104
01:15:30,711 --> 01:15:45,708
Who is okay?

105
01:15:45,708 --> 01:16:00,688
Why should I have such a Toko-chan? It doesn't matter which one you use from me.

106
01:16:00,688 --> 01:16:15,687
Let's meet in the shop world.

107
01:16:15,687 --> 01:16:45,715
Let's fish Roboco-san.

108
01:16:45,715 --> 01:17:00,656
Are you sure you're okay.

109
01:17:00,656 --> 01:17:15,710
I'm sorry 6 hours. Saki Remi-chan's day.

110
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:30,688
1 Zodiac Wherever it was. You did a task.

111
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:45,697
If you were there after that. You did it.

112
01:17:45,697 --> 01:18:15,639
Why why why

113
01:18:15,639 --> 01:19:00,716
Tara Sana-chan.

114
01:19:00,716 --> 01:19:15,773
It was good. If you finish killing, just happen to kill Sana-chan.

115
01:19:15,773 --> 01:19:30,720
The color of gloves has changed again.

116
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:45,767
It's a youkai. Leave home new.

117
01:19:45,767 --> 01:20:15,721
It was my first time, but then. It's okay because it's a phone call.

118
01:20:15,721 --> 01:20:45,679
It turned white and pink.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 01:21:04,716
Shall we go.

120
01:21:04,716 --> 01:21:19,792
Ao is scary. Experience It is possible that no one will come in. I don't like it.

121
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:34,815
Put it in, wait, wait, wait, no one.

122
01:21:34,815 --> 01:21:49,798
I didn't expect to be an ordinary person. I'm scared Pikmin-chan and Aoi-chan If either one is dead.

123
01:21:49,798 --> 01:22:04,822
I'm alive I'm alive I'm scared I have a need for 2.

124
01:22:04,822 --> 01:22:49,714
Yes.

125
01:22:49,714 --> 01:23:04,747
Because it's hard. When I saw it, I was alone and I couldn't hear it.

126
01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:19,793
I found it. I was scared and pushed.

127
01:23:19,793 --> 01:24:04,781
I want a lot of requests.

128
01:24:04,781 --> 01:24:19,794
Pon-chan Pon-chan Who is this? Stop it Stop 58737. If you do a person's name.

129
01:24:19,794 --> 01:24:34,786
Go home, go home, it's really okay. The Diet with a toilet pointer.

130
01:24:34,786 --> 01:24:49,830
Ponchan Yamada Denki rather than Ponchan. Please tell me that you are out.

131
01:24:49,830 --> 01:25:04,753
Here, here, here, here Kopi Kamiya Do you remember being killed?

132
01:25:04,753 --> 01:25:34,821
You took it. To my mother. Was it the same timing for Potos? Nap-chan That kind of thing.

133
01:25:34,821 --> 01:26:04,780
Just before Melon and Kana. This is running to.

134
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:19,831
When I went to the lower from the storage, it felt like I was back because there was a power outage. Maybe I saw that-chan.

135
01:26:19,831 --> 01:26:34,804
Pon-chan looks with a pretty white eye. Where are you guys

136
01:26:34,804 --> 01:26:49,773
We are heading from now on. Let's go to Imadomi. I feel like I saw Aoi-chan together.

137
01:26:49,773 --> 01:27:04,805
Is it a feeling?

138
01:27:04,805 --> 01:27:19,808
Electrical from storage to lower This storage release. There is little foundation.

139
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:34,723
I don't know.

140
01:27:34,723 --> 01:27:49,814
I think it's pretty stupid to collect them electrically. later.

141
01:27:49,814 --> 01:28:04,775
Kigami-chan feels rather white, though.

142
01:28:04,775 --> 01:28:19,809
Who is it?

143
01:28:19,809 --> 01:28:34,766
Please everyone is still there. Don't do that.

144
01:28:34,766 --> 01:28:49,821
Musashi Natori is amazing.

145
01:28:49,821 --> 01:29:04,783
This match is the strongest. This is the strongest.

146
01:29:04,783 --> 01:29:19,715
alone.

147
01:29:19,715 --> 01:30:04,791
But no one had a thread right now.

148
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:19,830
There were quite a few people in the electrical at first, hurts, hurts, hurts, hurts, heals. Wait, this is the confirmation, I said, right now no one is saying.

149
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:34,773
Electrical You're heading towards the two more reactors.

150
01:30:34,773 --> 01:30:49,796
Referendum Where. Electrical. Go to the name and maple and the upper engine and go to the cafeteria.

151
01:30:49,796 --> 01:31:04,773
together. I remembered walking.

152
01:31:04,773 --> 01:31:19,813
Electrical 2 part 2 Cafe. Onii-chan and Kaede-chan.

153
01:31:19,813 --> 01:31:34,797
I'm back, Met Bay.

154
01:31:34,797 --> 01:31:49,765
I think someone will go through or lose. Aori-chan. After Japan, it's about security.

155
01:31:49,765 --> 01:32:04,784
Communist Party surveillance camera Because I was dancing.

156
01:32:04,784 --> 01:32:19,822
Please do not arrive in Oita because it is a trio from Pin. Who is this time?

157
01:32:19,822 --> 01:32:34,807
There is no basis for a bad heart.

158
01:32:34,807 --> 01:32:49,812
Use it as a basis for your heart.

159
01:32:49,812 --> 01:33:04,772
Become. There are many places to rely on.

160
01:33:04,772 --> 01:33:19,809
One person is alone. Why?

161
01:33:19,809 --> 01:33:49,817
where. I came from the door.

162
01:33:49,817 --> 01:34:04,791
I see, Pika Mi-chan's TV.

163
01:34:04,791 --> 01:34:19,800
You're Seikin. I should have said that. Then I said I'd cure it with a reactor.

164
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:34,799
The varnish is tired.

165
01:34:34,799 --> 01:34:49,787
Niigata Nishi. It's a waste.

166
01:34:49,787 --> 01:35:04,807
I wonder if there is a possibility that it cannot be taken.

167
01:35:04,807 --> 01:35:34,787
I feel like I found it.

168
01:35:34,787 --> 01:35:49,763
Super Small Akari Mama and the reactor stopped together, though. I want you to take a closer look, but I see.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 01:36:06,699
There were about four people in 3 from the right.

170
01:36:06,699 --> 01:36:21,734
I think it's on the ice.

171
01:36:21,734 --> 01:36:36,711
I can't keep up. Who is the child?

172
01:36:36,711 --> 01:36:51,753
That's Roboco-san, I understand that you said it was scary. Everyone seems to have been loved by all Fat-chan, because they all make it by themselves.

173
01:36:51,753 --> 01:37:06,811
Electrical Ren-chan.

174
01:37:06,811 --> 01:37:36,750
It was difficult to do it.

175
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:51,745
I was hiding in the event when I charged. So that's it.

176
01:37:51,745 --> 01:38:21,695
After killing with Conical, let the power go out.

177
01:38:21,695 --> 01:38:36,736
Thank you very much. You don't call me. You see, I couldn't be alone with one person.

178
01:38:36,736 --> 01:38:51,724
It was good to have a dance in front of the surveillance camera.

179
01:38:51,724 --> 01:39:06,644
Are you going.

180
01:39:06,644 --> 01:39:21,711
I can't go home. Please wait a moment, I'm sorry.

181
01:39:21,711 --> 01:39:51,652
Ai Iijima. penalty.

182
01:39:51,652 --> 01:40:06,701
I missed it.

183
01:40:06,701 --> 01:40:21,641
I'm being threatened.

184
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:36,689
Probability of being killed.

185
01:40:36,689 --> 01:40:51,705
123 GO.

186
01:40:51,705 --> 01:41:06,707
It started on the 8th. The movie summer is really scary.

187
01:41:06,707 --> 01:41:21,718
Oh no no no.

188
01:41:21,718 --> 01:41:36,680
Hey hey hey you. I pretended not to see it before.

189
01:41:36,680 --> 01:42:06,706
Damn it's vivid and beautiful, isn't it? Go over there and look at me.

190
01:42:06,706 --> 01:42:21,714
Pero-chan.

191
01:42:21,714 --> 01:42:36,690
Who is all that grows fast? what.

192
01:42:36,690 --> 01:43:06,711
The part of the fish head. Ueno.

193
01:43:06,711 --> 01:43:21,654
Where was it?

194
01:43:21,654 --> 01:43:36,727
That Neon-chan came out first, right? Today's robot classroom. Two people went bankrupt and killed.

195
01:43:36,727 --> 01:43:51,701
I want to see Aoi-chan. I remember a little early.

196
01:43:51,701 --> 01:44:06,717
I saw Pompoko-chan in the middle of the cafeteria and storage.

197
01:44:06,717 --> 01:44:21,697
I went to Pikadon, but just before that person entered, I was an admin and everyone's case.

198
01:44:21,697 --> 01:44:51,728
Baby I have a baby, so with Gachaponpoco. That is the face of only a small number of people in Mint Storage.

199
01:44:51,728 --> 01:45:06,719
It's really cheap with Aoi-chan.

200
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:36,735
I'm really sorry I can't really come Surprised search.

201
01:45:36,735 --> 01:45:51,745
Aoi-chan. By the way, Aoi-chan was killed by whom. Aoi-chan is a song.

202
01:45:51,745 --> 01:46:06,709
release. It just happened quite a bit if I didn't do anything.

203
01:46:06,709 --> 01:46:21,648
Chinese characters.

204
01:46:21,648 --> 01:46:36,721
I don't think it looks black. That's right.

205
01:46:36,721 --> 01:46:51,717
So there. It's dangerous. It's really bad.

206
01:46:51,717 --> 01:47:06,710
It's for maternity.

207
01:47:06,710 --> 01:47:21,720
When it's over, I have to feel like eating.

208
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:51,694
I don't know. Because my job is at home.

209
01:47:51,694 --> 01:48:21,744
understood. If my twins were killed with this, I would.

210
01:48:21,744 --> 01:48:36,770
It suddenly emerges. So protect each other.

211
01:48:36,770 --> 01:48:51,722
I wish I could go to the animals.

212
01:48:51,722 --> 01:49:21,734
You got up. He said he did a ghost pop. I'm not really sorry.

213
01:49:21,734 --> 01:49:51,723
Tagawa Can Japan take it? Can you kill me? This is this blog.

214
01:49:51,723 --> 01:50:06,720
I have no choice but to pull them apart.

215
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:21,731
Makoto is this. On the contrary, it was urgently called.

216
01:50:21,731 --> 01:50:36,753
On the contrary, it may not be possible to kill. Grilled. There is no Meiwa town.

217
01:50:36,753 --> 01:50:51,692
I think it's flying. Yurufuwa store.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 01:51:08,572
I'm doing it because no one knows.

219
01:51:08,572 --> 01:51:23,564
I got in the way over there. We're definitely doing it, I heard it sleeping already.

220
01:51:23,564 --> 01:51:38,594
I wanted to go to the hospital.

221
01:51:38,594 --> 01:51:53,577
Licca-chan I want to do a momentary power outage. I wonder if I can go a little longer.

222
01:51:53,577 --> 01:52:08,590
I wish I had it, but I wonder if I can go. What is the voice of Micchan and Aoi?

223
01:52:08,590 --> 01:52:23,547
Hi yeah yeah yeah.

224
01:52:23,547 --> 01:52:38,561
I've heard a little about it.

225
01:52:38,561 --> 01:52:53,579
Do it all the time, once on the right side of the lower engine. Go with Niponpoko-chan and my sister.

226
01:52:53,579 --> 01:53:08,537
What should i do?

227
01:53:08,537 --> 01:53:23,584
So far, that killing hasn't happened, so it's only one for the latter.

228
01:53:23,584 --> 01:53:53,593
I wonder if Kami-chan is good for Oi-chan.

229
01:53:53,593 --> 01:54:08,559
I'm sure it will take you. Aoi-chan is Aoi-chan. Aoi-chan.

230
01:54:08,559 --> 01:54:23,583
Even if I still don't understand, I can enter alone.

231
01:54:23,583 --> 01:54:38,575
35 seconds, why?

232
01:54:38,575 --> 01:54:53,582
I did it, I did it, I did it.

233
01:54:53,582 --> 01:55:08,607
Good morning. Baba Konomi.

234
01:55:08,607 --> 01:55:23,562
A fleeting word that scratches my feet.

235
01:55:23,562 --> 01:56:08,556
I'm getting it done.

236
01:56:08,556 --> 01:56:23,545
I thought I'd do it.

237
01:56:23,545 --> 01:56:38,545
It was hard. I was hit.

238
01:56:38,545 --> 01:56:53,501
Please.

239
01:56:53,501 --> 01:57:08,585

242
01:57:38,509 --> 01:57:53,569
This shadow approaching from behind is scary. And I am. I believed that Mi-chan would do it.

243
01:57:53,569 --> 01:58:08,558
I want you to come with me. Wii.

244
01:58:08,558 --> 01:58:23,571

Animate Speak alone. The foundation is my heart.

247
01:58:53,606 --> 01:59:08,584
This is this. Where did everyone go?

248
01:59:08,584 --> 01:59:23,547
I wanted to do it. But don't touch anybody.

249
01:59:23,547 --> 01:59:38,561
It's a kettle. It's a kettle.

250

I saw Admin.

252
02:00:08,569 --> 02:00:23,554
I wonder if he was dead in some passage. Very fast. I thought I'd follow him.

253
02:00:23,554 --> 02:00:38,578
Because the floating mom stopped for a while before the first disturbance occurred. I want you to say mom.

254
02:00:38,578 --> 02:00:53,597
I think you saw it.

255
02:00:53,597 --> 02:01:08,554
You can spread your legs. It's about time.

256
02:01:08,554 --> 02:01:23,584
No way. What time is it to take the rope and return?

257
02:01:23,584 --> 02:01:38,593
May I go together if we are two? I was old and waited alone and was here.

This is Drapo. Hana-chan.

265
02:03:53,580 --> 02:04:08,545
Because no one will get married. Swan and swan.

Look closely. Can't you join tomorrow and wear it?

267
02:04:23,592 --> 02:04:38,605
Tomoko Aso and my friends I didn't see at all. Because I took Natori.

268
02:04:38,605 --> 02:05:08,656
If there are any leftovers, double killing will end. That's why I want to fish alone.

269
02:05:08,656 --> 02:05:23,564
do not know. If a corpse is found, it's white.

270
