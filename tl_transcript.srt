1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,318
Inosuke comes out That Betelgeuse by all means. Inosuke I like it the most. I just cut my finger.

2
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:45,254
It was the same production, isn't it?

3
00:00:45,254 --> 00:01:00,145
Rice skates of the same production. later, OK.

4
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:15,098
There was a voice actor's program, and I had been watching it for quite some time during the holidays.

5
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:30,163
But I saw Mr. Matsuoka appearing. Kirito It's like playing Kirito's voice or changing the settings.

6
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:45,151
Well. It's an accumulation. Call the star 3 that another famous person is doing.

7
00:01:45,151 --> 00:02:00,107
It's something like acting. Toyama snow cover.

8
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:15,143
Which coal. Suneo Suneo comes first.

9
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:30,098
After seeing it, I saw it. The person who is doing the voice of Sailor Moon.

10
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:45,160
Just stop the dirty nails from getting dirty. It's like that.

11
00:02:45,160 --> 00:03:00,119
Seki-san treats that kind of thing, and you can get out of it. Sailor Moon's movie is going on right now.

12
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:15,136
Look at it on YouTube. I was cleaning it. I thought it was amazing.

13
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:30,153
Watanabe came.

14
00:03:30,153 --> 00:03:45,138
I saw only 3 episodes Somehow cats Cats come out I saw only the ones.

15
00:03:45,138 --> 00:04:00,129
I'm sorry it was Mr. Mitsuishi and Mr. Nakanishi. I made a mistake in reading it. It's a whirlwind, it's really popular, isn't it?

16
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:15,138
I know Nyacki. It was like Nyacki!

17
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:30,112
Please make a note of baking only the gnocchi. I'm glad I met Mitsui-san. Meow basic hornworm.

18
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:45,159
It was like that with my lower teeth. It's like taking a picture with a command robin and making it into an animation.

19
00:04:45,159 --> 00:05:00,144
It's like moving it little by little and taking time-lapse shots to make it look like it's moving. Nyacki I felt Nyacki.

20
00:05:00,144 --> 00:05:15,143
Clay clay animation. I think it's taking a lot of time.

21
00:05:15,143 --> 00:05:30,095
Production period is one and a half years. It's too amazing.

22
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:45,123
Nyacki's director's student protects or makes it. That's right.

23
00:05:45,123 --> 00:06:00,152
Debt My wife signed clothes. I'm back. All 12 episodes in 3.

24
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:15,154
After all it takes time to make a good work.

25
00:06:15,154 --> 00:06:30,171
Gnocchi keeps making gnocchi of the same thickness Well, that's right, it's strange if it suddenly becomes thinner.

26
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:45,124
Wow. Did you enjoy your vacation?

27
00:06:45,124 --> 00:07:00,169
Above all, the operator is very happy that the room has become insanely clean. I'm glad it's not over yet, but it's playing.

28
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:15,179
After all it feels good and the room is clean. 700 years old 6 years old.

29
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:30,152
Why? Mystery What smell What is it In response to what smell.

30
00:07:30,152 --> 00:07:45,136
I don't know if the air purifier is bright red. Thank you with my aunt.

31
00:07:45,136 --> 00:08:00,122
I can't buy the position of the monitor. That and that. Wipe everything with a disinfectant sheet.

32
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:15,209
Monitor shiny now. Shiny. Good vibes. No one has come now.

33
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:30,093
Also for pork.

34
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:45,125
I wonder if I used alcohol sterilization. But it's beautiful.

35
00:08:45,125 --> 00:09:00,130
Certainly there is a feeling of cleaning at the end of the year. Certainly 6 people. I couldn't do it because I was on vacation.

36
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:15,134
I'm taking a bath I'm taking a bath today. Dust has accumulated on the filter. I just opened it.

37
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:30,122
Alcoholic. react. Is that it?

38
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:45,127
It. With alcohol. I blew all the liquid tabs. Is that so?

39
00:09:45,127 --> 00:10:00,104
That was good. It was very nice. It became. I see.

40
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:15,117
I wonder if I will wait and see. What if it doesn't disappear for days?

41
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:30,097
Let's see it again later. Let's take a look inside.

42
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:45,049
To do.

43
00:10:45,049 --> 00:11:00,132
Don't tell me that you can wipe it with alcohol.

44
00:11:00,132 --> 00:11:15,129
For the time being, try to have a relationship. No, it's cold. It's cold. It's cold tomorrow.

45
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:30,147
After wiping with alcohol, the coating goes out.

46
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:45,108
Let's be intolerant next time. It's snowing tomorrow.

47
00:11:45,108 --> 00:12:00,143
That wasn't it, it was really expensive. It was really expensive when I saw it. It's not like a muffler.

48
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:15,137
It took me a while. Is it such a cold? I don't know.

49
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:30,170
The temperature difference is amazing. Let's stop healing tomorrow.

50
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:45,137
Let's stop getting a little chills. Nami-chan 3D will be unveiled, so I wonder if I can go.

51
00:12:45,137 --> 00:13:00,149
3D unveiling that makes it snow. Fight against each other with your heart. I wish I could burn my heart and make a cannon.

52
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:15,138
I can't cash it forever. As it is. Of which.

53
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:30,049
Of which.

54
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:45,169
But that's about it. I haven't eaten it yet. Somehow, white strawberries. There was a white strawberry and I bought it.

55
00:13:45,169 --> 00:14:00,173
If you go to the supermarket, there are white strawberries. I bought it but haven't eaten it yet. I wonder if the rain is sweet. I think it was quite expensive.

56
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:15,127
So white strawberries. I did my best to keep things tidy.

57
00:14:15,127 --> 00:14:30,165
I bought it as a reward. Somehow 8 grains 8 grains. It was about. Katakana.

58
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:45,166
It's a waste and I haven't eaten yet. Everybody will fly when they eat.

59
00:14:45,166 --> 00:15:00,108
You can eat ordinary strawberries. Luxury. I bought it. I bought it.

60
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:15,125
If you don't eat it early, it will be damaged.

61
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:30,105
It's the same with 10,000 pearls.

62
00:15:30,105 --> 00:15:45,184
I've never eaten that much. Get on eating properly before your teeth hurt.

63
00:15:45,184 --> 00:16:00,151
I'll eat it later. It's okay to chat while mogomogo.

64
00:16:00,151 --> 00:16:15,152
I'm gonna eat it. When are you going to eat now? Can i eat it?

65
00:16:15,152 --> 00:16:30,187
Let's eat a little more Let's eat Welcome back commemoration. The first castle 15.

66
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:45,147
But that's really what I did during the holidays. I sleep for 12 hours.

67
00:16:45,147 --> 00:17:00,176
I'm going to start decluttering. I'll start reading everyone's letters from there. I will cut it off while watching YouTube.

68
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:15,152
Sleep. Put. I sleep in.

69
00:17:15,152 --> 00:17:30,104
Poop man. Look at the blade of annihilation. I'm going home.

70
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:45,139
I wonder what I was doing, and the tweet on the third day. Tomica's tweet.

71
00:17:45,139 --> 00:18:00,156
I was able to do it, but 3 minutes 8 mega. Send people and stir-fry three of them. For the time being.

72
00:18:00,156 --> 00:18:15,167
I wondered if this was the acidity, so I stopped. Sazae-senpai told me that I couldn't like or retweet the lipo.

73
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:30,173
that too. I wonder if it's eaten. Put it in and stop it.

74
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:45,156
Yomoya Yomoya Actually, I was thinking of retweeting the birthday delivery of the fool senior, but a sample.

75
00:18:45,156 --> 00:19:00,134
I was thinking about it by calculating it properly. Because there are only 3 tweets. I was thinking about tweeting the birthday guy.

76
00:19:00,134 --> 00:19:15,176
Playing tag I heard playing tag, so I stole it.

77
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:30,143
I want to enter if there is. Speaking to Mana-chan, I don't know what to do.

78
00:19:30,143 --> 00:19:45,139
I wonder if it was there. So I didn't call out.

79
00:19:45,139 --> 00:20:00,144
As much as possible the latest thing. Too much. Because I was saying.

80
00:20:00,144 --> 00:20:15,125
So do you call it a reply? Is it alright. I didn't contact you.

81
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:30,123
But egosurfing. English shower. English does every day.

82
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:45,056
It's cute, isn't it?

83
00:20:45,056 --> 00:21:00,120
I quit I was watching I was watching everyone. About everyone.

84
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:15,077
You're okay.

85
00:21:15,077 --> 00:21:30,119
I saw you.

86
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:45,142
I'm really looking at it, everyone is lonely. Hypothermia even though I'm not lonely.

87
00:21:45,142 --> 00:22:00,119
I'm not bad at all.

88
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:15,119
It's similar.

89
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:30,147
Anyone can stream it. I didn't watch it. I want to comment. A dentist around here. Don't look at it for a moment.

90
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:45,165
I was there. Perhaps a scene that makes you want to do something like Micra.

91
00:22:45,165 --> 00:23:00,102
Everyone was full of Micra. Like rap battles.

92
00:23:00,102 --> 00:23:15,142
I spent time listening to the sea and the bracelets and the surrounding areas. Tatsumi Hanshin I saw it until it was red.

93
00:23:15,142 --> 00:23:30,091
Seen in real time. I want to commit it.

94
00:23:30,091 --> 00:23:45,119
Memo Welcome to the newspaper. Slow Pecos It was a low life.

95
00:23:45,119 --> 00:24:00,129
But that's what I did.

96
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:15,130
Not much going out at all. I'll put out about Kanto Kimetsuno Yaiba.

97
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:30,131
I wish I could talk about something more. From about 12 o'clock. It's a little cool.

98
00:24:30,131 --> 00:24:45,102
I'm wondering what to do with the video from now on. English edition.

99
00:24:45,102 --> 00:25:00,152
Sukegoro. Inari sushi. With Inari sushi I bought at the supermarket.

100
00:25:00,152 --> 00:25:15,134
Curry champion curry.

101
00:25:15,134 --> 00:25:30,143
I didn't eat out.

102
00:25:30,143 --> 00:25:45,148
When I bought white strawberries, I bought sushi and went home. I ate sushi. Champion curry. Sweet. This is also a gift for everyone.

103
00:25:45,148 --> 00:26:00,142
I did it. I'm addicted to Champion Curry.

104
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:15,127
It was as usual. It's 9 at home as usual.

105
00:26:15,127 --> 00:26:30,192
I feel like I'm feeling a little sick. Not scary. Is it just me? If you do something a little different from your daily rhythm.

106
00:26:30,192 --> 00:26:45,146
Something like catching a cold. I think it's strong.

107
00:26:45,146 --> 00:27:00,169
If you just eat out and feel like you're feeling tired, you don't like it. It's important. It's also a house where you get used to it.

108
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:15,120
What too much Standard of living.

109
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:30,142
I hear that if you give it, you won't be able to lower it next time. I don't want to give it. Dolphin video.

110
00:27:30,142 --> 00:27:45,105
I will pick flowers. Yes Yes Yes.

111
00:27:45,105 --> 00:28:00,136
I can't even lower it to yogurt. Because I hear you can't lower the sound.

112
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:15,150
I can only eat white strawberries. I don't eat strawberries though. It's good because I don't eat strawberries.

113
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:30,115
Maybe the road can't be lowered. Maybe I can only eat Shine Muscat.

114
00:28:30,115 --> 00:28:45,128
Well a lot of luxury.

115
00:28:45,128 --> 00:29:00,126
I think I'm scared when I sleep and feel like I'm not a child who is no longer a luxury. I had some shopping.

116
00:29:00,126 --> 00:29:15,121
I made my own sleeping pillow. Dedicated pillow.

117
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:30,103
Oh yeah yeah until now. Who was the one who came with the futon? It was a pillow.

118
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:45,129
I've been using pillows like that that come with a set of futons instead of a terrific one. The one to measure. what is there.

119
00:29:45,129 --> 00:30:00,149
That's kind of dismissal. What is the back waist? Measure.

120
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:15,133
Search. Yes Yes. Standard of living origin Dan I thought sleep was good.

121
00:30:15,133 --> 00:30:30,123
For the time being. No. 7. I thought it was okay.

122
00:30:30,123 --> 00:30:45,099
so. later, OK. That Shingu. Something.

123
00:30:45,099 --> 00:31:00,082
This is also said by Mane-chan, but that. I'm told.

124
00:31:00,082 --> 00:31:15,117
That mat is the one that changes the bed a little. The thickness of sheep's hair. Hey, it was kind of fluffy.

125
00:31:15,117 --> 00:31:30,115
I bought it together there. Norton's.

126
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:45,143
So from now on, wrapped in sheep's hair. Don't buy with 3 digits 10,000 yen Don't buy.

127
00:31:45,143 --> 00:32:00,132
This is Nitori's bed.

128
00:32:00,132 --> 00:32:15,120
It was really good, even if I spilled soy sauce.

129
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:30,170
You can get rid of the odor just by hanging it over water, sticking it on and wiping it. I can't get it, though. That's why sweat doesn't seem to soak into the rain. The one who hears such a thing.

130
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:45,104
Nagano A little big game from now on. Please lie down on it.

131
00:32:45,104 --> 00:33:00,138
Easy to clean. I think it's good.

132
00:33:00,138 --> 00:33:15,178
I thought it was better than going home with a set of beds. Yup. And also the cherry blossoms. maintenance.

133
00:33:15,178 --> 00:33:30,151
Think and sleep. When I was worried about that. If you take it to an affiliated store.

134
00:33:30,151 --> 00:33:45,148
I mean, it seems that it will be replaced and it will make a sound for free. I thought it wasn't because of that, so maintenance. I got it.

135
00:33:45,148 --> 00:34:00,159
When I'm hungry, it changes the sound of the contents. I just haven't slept yet.

136
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:15,123
Sheep hair. It's a little ahead.

137
00:34:15,123 --> 00:34:30,131
Nakano, Tama-ku I want to dry it once. Pillowcase I wanted to dry it, but a little. I haven't dried it in Pokemon yet. I want to wash it.

138
00:34:30,131 --> 00:34:45,122
I want to go to bed after getting up. Welcome back Thank you. Fun to reach.

139
00:34:45,122 --> 00:35:00,126
I thought I was looking for a wife because the cat is also fluffy. I have a father. That's why.

140
00:35:00,126 --> 00:35:15,132
Sheep's hair is amazing. I'm looking forward to it. I'm a liar, but I still have a washing machine.

141
00:35:15,132 --> 00:35:30,124
Kentucky also arrived. How to stop playing.

142
00:35:30,124 --> 00:35:45,134
I bought it, but I haven't received it. Sheep's hair is amazing.

143
00:35:45,134 --> 00:36:00,156
After all it's amazing, sheep's hair. I'll take notes.

144
00:36:00,156 --> 00:36:15,143
By that time, maybe it will take about 3 weeks, 7 cases will come a little earlier. I want to be in the morning.

145
00:36:15,143 --> 00:36:30,136
This is not a matter of matter.

146
00:36:30,136 --> 00:36:45,124
I wonder if I had something to talk about, I think it happened. It looks like something happened.

147
00:36:45,124 --> 00:37:00,110
I thought I'd talk about that.

148
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:15,115
Famima Famima Famima Famima, like I thought I'd talk about something. FamilyMart. FamilyMart.

149
00:37:15,115 --> 00:37:30,162
Watanabe's. It looks like it's finally on sale, so I saw it, like the people who went to buy it.

150
00:37:30,162 --> 00:37:45,123
The person who said it or the person who said it was sold out. The topic that I couldn't buy then works for me.

151
00:37:45,123 --> 00:38:00,104
I couldn't get it. It was sold out.

152
00:38:00,104 --> 00:38:15,116
Wow, it's sold out. Well, that's right. It's amazing.

153
00:38:15,116 --> 00:38:30,125
There was a poster, right? clear file. From January 20th. I think it was about 850 yen for eco.

154
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:45,121
There was a product that was included in.

155
00:38:45,121 --> 00:39:00,124
But. I was happy I could only buy Famichiki. The officials should probably eat Famichiki.

156
00:39:00,124 --> 00:39:15,169
Ask for resale Really ask for resale.

157
00:39:15,169 --> 00:39:30,127
I was able to get the rain again, but I thought I should go to the general meeting. I don't know where it is. I thought that.

158
00:39:30,127 --> 00:39:45,153
It arrived. Color. I got all kinds of that. Smile.

159
00:39:45,153 --> 00:40:00,145
I thought I should go, but it arrived suddenly and I was in danger of going. The ship I was going to buy. I'm sorry everyone.

160
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:15,152
That break.

161
00:40:15,152 --> 00:40:30,156
Fisheye AAA type. Yeah Yeah That's it, it arrived with that rubber mat.

162
00:40:30,156 --> 00:40:45,127
Is it actually how to use it? Well everyone was cute.

163
00:40:45,127 --> 00:41:00,138
It's not a masterpiece if you arrange this.

164
00:41:00,138 --> 00:41:15,103
Is it one kind?

165
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:30,104
Who is your favorite? bar. I have that sheep cub, but only that one.

166
00:41:30,104 --> 00:41:45,101
There is a little blonde child, isn't it?

167
00:41:45,101 --> 00:42:00,132
I'm not. I recommend it. You're raising your hand. Only one. The one with different clothes.

168
00:42:00,132 --> 00:42:15,116
There are some children who can see the skin color only on the side.

169
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:30,147
There is gold that shows off affairs. That's right. Over there.

170
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:45,118
I wonder if there is additional production.

171
00:42:45,118 --> 00:43:00,093
Because everyone is cute. There is no wind so please buy it.

172
00:43:00,093 --> 00:43:15,140
What's wrong with masturbation? Youkai Youkai Show off your armpits.

173
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:30,124
Additional production is possible. But I can't believe it. I don't know.

174
00:43:30,124 --> 00:43:45,148
It was hard to imagine. until now. Sahono. I bought two.

175
00:43:45,148 --> 00:44:00,131
If you buy three, the power will come on.

176
00:44:00,131 --> 00:44:15,083
Because I was a mother.

177
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:30,137
Nayoro Yayoi Announcer. I don't.

180
00:45:00,127 --> 00:45:15,120
Flower figure Nendoroid I want to be Yamada It's still open. Dreams haven't come yet.

181
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:30,113
Woman's holiday What time do you think about it today?

182
00:45:30,113 --> 00:45:45,171
Let's talk until about 2 o'clock and then stop supermarket for a while. I wonder if I can let you. Mike is okay. Mike 1.

183
00:45:45,171 --> 00:46:00,139
It's not tattered at all. Rather, Watanabe's finger is tattered. I arranged it in that letter and cut it in two places with paper.

184
00:46:00,139 --> 00:46:15,140
Also, take Oronamin C today. Two people cut their fingers. Something.

185
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:30,133
High high is okay to eat. You only have to do it once.

186
00:46:30,133 --> 00:46:45,175
Now my finger glasses are tattered. The letter is okay. The letter is also pin-pinned, so it's too pin-pinned and my fingers are cut off.

187
00:46:45,175 --> 00:47:00,106
Oronamin C Lid All right, I just have it. But yes be careful. Be careful, stick a plaster now.

188
00:47:00,106 --> 00:47:15,195
Oronamin C is okay, but I've already drank it. Welcome Mr. Hatsumi.

189
00:47:15,195 --> 00:47:30,134
It's no good. Nylon Building No. 9 Is it a game? I'm sorry.

190
00:47:30,134 --> 00:47:45,141
If you leave it without throwing it away. That's what makes it a room.

191
00:47:45,141 --> 00:48:00,148
It looks like it's going to stray, but it's okay.

192
00:48:00,148 --> 00:48:15,113
Well then. Oronamin C After a long time.

193
00:48:15,113 --> 00:48:45,098
If I have a plan tomorrow morning, this bandage.

194
00:48:45,098 --> 00:49:00,119
It's a Bingata connector. Something like that, I feel like it was my summer vacation. Collect caps.

195
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:15,120
Enter the river or something. I feel like I found it.

196
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:45,100
There was. Is it my summer night?

197
00:49:45,100 --> 00:50:00,100
Summer vacation is nice Everyone is on vacation What are you doing? Watanabe I got three consecutive holidays.

198
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:15,114
What during the three consecutive holidays?

199
00:50:15,114 --> 00:50:30,158
Horozanmai. Looking at the archive, the holidays are over and it is the second delivery. What is a holiday?

200
00:50:30,158 --> 00:50:45,089
There is also a partner. Blue game playback. I don't dig while studying.

201
00:50:45,089 --> 00:51:00,099
Kickboxing is amazing. Active. Doraemon. When Watanabe is out, I see Gran.

202
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:15,119
Embark on a journey by motorcycle.

203
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:30,122
Hanshin Marriage Many people are watching me, thank you. I'm still delivering it. Hey you.

204
00:51:30,122 --> 00:51:45,132
After returning. I don't have a day off. Hakodate.

205
00:51:45,132 --> 00:52:00,126
It's hard, so when are you sleeping? Sometimes I see a dentist at the campsite.

206
00:52:00,126 --> 00:52:15,081
A dog for four consecutive holidays from today.

207
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:30,125
Questionnaire for me The day ends just by introducing the product.

208
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:45,145
One time is long, isn't it? I've been saying this for 3 hours, but it's been 3 hours.

209
00:52:45,145 --> 00:53:00,115
I think it would be nice to go once and do it again for 3 hours. It's getting longer. Who is it already?

210
00:53:00,115 --> 00:53:15,140
On the contrary. That one hour delivery. 3 hours delivery.

211
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:30,124
It 's a little okay, it 's not short. There is a time. I wonder if it's over.

212
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:45,134
My sister's break. There is some kind of feeling. What is a bug?

213
00:53:45,134 --> 00:54:00,167
Somehow my senses are crazy and crazy.

214
00:54:00,167 --> 00:54:15,142
I don't think I'll have to decide if I should talk until about 2 o'clock and then read it properly. I have to decide. It's bad not to decide.

215
00:54:15,142 --> 00:54:30,056
It's true.

216
00:54:30,056 --> 00:54:45,115
Today, from the evening, we have a little meeting. By then.

217
00:54:45,115 --> 00:55:00,174
Even if you decide, you can stretch it. Why can't I help it because I'm having fun.

218
00:55:00,174 --> 00:55:15,390
It doesn't end because it's fun. Last game Last game scheduled.

219
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:30,183
In the end, I don't know what the Last Game Final of the End Omega is. Thank you for your compliment.

220
00:55:30,183 --> 00:55:45,045
Ah.

221
00:55:45,045 --> 00:56:00,133
There are quite a lot of things I want to do, and there are many things like Micra Micra.

222
00:56:00,133 --> 00:56:15,116
next. Daddy doing the final volume of V tenor and doing Sakunahime.

223
00:56:15,116 --> 00:56:30,093
Paper, not Abe.

224
00:56:30,093 --> 00:56:45,116
A lot of things I want to do. Paper print app.

225
00:56:45,116 --> 00:57:00,104
Immigration guy. What kind of game is it? Please go to Papers, Please.

226
00:57:00,104 --> 00:57:15,129
Try it. Try it. I asked Amatra to do it again later.

227
00:57:15,129 --> 00:57:30,102
I can do it, but maybe. I wonder if I can still do it halfway. I feel like it was.

228
00:57:30,102 --> 00:57:45,129
From page 7 onwards. It was like a feeling.

229
00:57:45,129 --> 00:58:00,094
Dragonet is interesting. It will be released on the 28th.

230
00:58:00,094 --> 00:58:15,142
What is TSUTAYA's new work?

231
00:58:15,142 --> 00:58:30,100
What about Disgaea 6 I don't know if it's okay to go yet.

232
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:45,070
Was it already 8?

233
00:58:45,070 --> 00:59:00,123
28 steps. I thought it was 26. January 28.

234
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:15,145
The best in Japan. Soft Disgaea 6. 4 days left.

235
00:59:15,145 --> 00:59:30,116
I want to go. It doesn't end.

236
00:59:30,116 --> 00:59:45,076
That's true. I want to do it. There is no end. I will go for the rest of my life.

237
00:59:45,076 --> 01:00:15,149
But I want to do various things. Teke Teke.

238
01:00:15,149 --> 01:00:30,167
This is Teke Teke. I'm also worried about that. bird. Still looking at it at all.

239
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:45,147
Was it a horror game? Horror game Teketeke Teketeke Teketeke. What were you doing, Pekora-senpai?

240
01:00:45,147 --> 01:01:00,098
I want to go there already. I'm scared.

241
01:01:00,098 --> 01:01:15,113
Is it really strong?

242
01:01:15,113 --> 01:01:30,105
The picture with a non-progressable bug. Then it's better to do it after it's healed.

243
01:01:30,105 --> 01:01:45,089
Teke Teke Gross story Why. trauma.

244
01:01:45,089 --> 01:02:00,140
Something from that kind of system. Lissage is stronger.

245
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:15,110
I wonder if it's just inflation. I was the scariest. Is it just friction?

246
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:30,128
I'm not good at money or someone who is threatened suddenly.

247
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:45,151
But I didn't realize that the two of them were really surprised at the miso taste.

248
01:02:00,140 --> 01:03:00,115
The blue sky and transcendence are strong. Route 7 to Muroike.

249
01:02:00,140 --> 01:03:15,115
What kind of place is it? That's a little.

250
01:02:00,140 --> 01:03:30,135
Hanako was scared though. The first was the scariest. It was strong from the beginning.

251
01:02:00,140 --> 01:03:45,125
I wonder if another strength can be cleared until the end. I thought I needed technology.

252
01:03:45,125 --> 01:04:00,135
OK I only remember 2 weeks.

253
01:04:00,135 --> 01:04:15,166
That's easy, OK. It was exciting for a moment. It was fun. It was the most fun. This is the fear as a distributor. I wonder if it's over. Somehow the latter half is easier.

254
01:04:15,166 --> 01:04:30,106
Highly murderous. You didn't break the action game.

255
01:04:30,106 --> 01:04:45,118
It was fun, Hanako-san, there was a lot of volume.

256
01:04:45,118 --> 01:05:00,105
It's kind of different from the ones I've had so far. It was fun with kanji.

257
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:15,160
The volume was the most amazing. The top called Todoroki-san.

258
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:30,117
I just haven't done it yet.

259
01:05:30,117 --> 01:05:45,096
Dog dog ringing tunnel. I haven't been there yet. I was saved.

260
01:05:45,096 --> 01:06:00,120
I bought it but I feel like I haven't been there yet. Inunaki tunnel.

261
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:15,117
Is it scary? The demo is really strong. It takes about 3 hours to clear such rice, even if it takes 1 hour for everyone to clear it.

262
01:06:15,117 --> 01:06:30,145
right. I saw it for a moment Wikipedia I saw it. Inunaki tunnel. Inunaki Village.

263
01:06:30,145 --> 01:06:45,095
It seems that there used to be such a thing.

264
01:06:45,095 --> 01:07:00,146
I hear that Mayfly is also difficult. Introducing Watanabe. I wonder if there are various Inunaki tunnels.

265
01:07:00,146 --> 01:07:15,138
There is Inunaki Pass, but it's a substitute.

266
01:07:15,138 --> 01:07:30,140
First Membership Thank you Welcome to Membership Welcome. Just a badge.

267
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:45,136
Mayflies are scary and difficult. I've seen Okaya-senpai doing it for a while, but it's footsteps.

268
01:07:45,136 --> 01:08:00,164
I want to escape to something and see summer. You shouldn't overdo the psychic spot.

269
01:08:00,164 --> 01:08:15,176
scary scary. Mayfly is okay because it has a difficulty level in.

270
01:08:15,176 --> 01:08:30,115
Really. Thank you. The wolf has never given me.

271
01:08:30,115 --> 01:08:45,107
I've never done it. However.

272
01:08:45,107 --> 01:09:00,137
It's your birthday. from everyone. There was a wolf on my birthday. That's right.

273
01:09:00,137 --> 01:09:15,138
I've done it, but I'm waiting for the time to get better.

274
01:09:15,138 --> 01:09:30,158
There was something about the resurrection. I had to take a short break for two days now. I'll be busy this year too, so around here.

275
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:45,093
Did I get a suggestion to take a rest and take a rest? Fufufu-san doesn't have it.

276
01:09:45,093 --> 01:10:00,046
Yes.

277
01:10:00,046 --> 01:10:15,104
Rest when you rest, yeah yeah yeah yeah. I tell you to take a rest when you come. Let's take a rest.

278
01:10:15,104 --> 01:10:30,162
I wonder if I was able to rest properly. It's fine just on the road. It may have been moving all the time. It may be useless if something is not done.

279
01:10:30,162 --> 01:11:00,126
Something I want to do on this vacation. It looks warm, rest your throat. That's right. I didn't eat it.

280
01:11:00,126 --> 01:11:15,133
Workaholic sheep. I wonder if that's true.

281
01:11:15,133 --> 01:11:30,114
I wonder if it was good to be able to cut it off. I thought I had to sort it out, but I left it as it was.

282
01:11:30,114 --> 01:11:45,121
It seems like I'm not coming anymore with this opportunity. Decluttered. The nerd was really fine.

283
01:11:45,121 --> 01:12:00,140
I'm fine when I take a rest. After all the voice comes out.

284
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:15,100
It seems to be important to take the plunge. Not much because I made my debut. did not come.

285
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:30,111
I felt like I had three consecutive holidays. I realized that it was important.

286
01:12:30,111 --> 01:12:45,085
That's right. It's important to take a day off. Realize the importance of holidays.

287
01:12:45,085 --> 01:13:00,113
I won't die. Over a year.

288
01:13:00,113 --> 01:13:15,122
I learned. often.

289
01:13:15,122 --> 01:13:30,143
Every month Meat Day I can't rest tomorrow Because Meat Day was a day I couldn't rest. It's the day I made my debut.

290
01:13:30,143 --> 01:13:45,123
But that's right. If you get tired, take a rest and then do a short delivery.

291
01:13:45,123 --> 01:14:00,124
But I don't want to take a rest.

292
01:14:00,124 --> 01:14:15,109
I'm grateful for that environment.

293
01:14:15,109 --> 01:14:30,109
Can you do it? Everything is so much fun because it makes me want to do it. Sing the game.

294
01:14:30,109 --> 01:14:45,158
I'm sleeping properly I'm sleeping properly.

295
01:14:45,158 --> 01:15:00,133
Short delivery call 5 Short delivery call 10. Such vegetables.

296
01:15:00,133 --> 01:15:15,145
What game will you play next? Short delivery. code.

297
01:15:15,145 --> 01:15:30,130
