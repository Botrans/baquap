1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,605
There is no such person. So forgive me.

2
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:34,614
You can actually do anything. What can I do if I have 1000 yen?

3
00:00:34,614 --> 00:00:49,611
Even if I go to a distant cousin, I can go home. Matsui's transportation expenses I have a runny nose.

4
00:00:49,611 --> 00:01:04,611
I'm back. I have a crush for 8 years.

5
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:34,604
It's dangerous. I don't confess the moment I think, everyone.

6
00:01:34,604 --> 00:01:49,709
All you have to do is think that you like what you want to do. There is nothing.

7
00:01:49,709 --> 00:02:04,610
The moment I thought I liked it right away confessed, for example, who is this? There was a person who liked me. Go over there.

8
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:19,584
It's not as light as it sounds.

9
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:34,624
Unrequited love, confess, and dating. If you dating, your senses will change again. Absolutely that. It seems to be chara.

10
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:49,597
The girl is crazy about that. I don't think it's a little.

11
00:02:49,597 --> 00:03:04,639
What is this guy? It's different to confess that you're talking to me, so please go out with me because I like it.

12
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:19,605
I don't think it's free. There's even the word me, so it's okay. I'm scared if shaken.

13
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:34,592
This is a drama that makes me nervous. I can't go out with you.

14
00:03:34,592 --> 00:03:49,612
The one who is scared is forever. I can't say. That's why I also convey my memory properly.

15
00:03:49,612 --> 00:04:04,614
So that time is that time. Confession is like an audition, so the people who wanted it at that time were different.

16
00:04:04,614 --> 00:04:19,616
It's so fluffy Let's clear what everyone wants to say.

17
00:04:19,616 --> 00:04:34,664
I wish I could get along with you at the winter festival, but you are in love with water. You can't get along with all of the 800,000 members.

18
00:04:34,664 --> 00:04:49,671
There is no guarantee that a festival that you should confess will definitely come on. It's not like that, but I really like it.

19
00:04:49,671 --> 00:05:04,667
What if the other side feels the same? Marumaru-kun confesses.

20
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:19,618
I only think that. Another child confessed, and are you happy with that feeling? Then what would you do?

21
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:34,545
that's right.

22
00:05:34,545 --> 00:05:49,616
Give me flowers. It's always difficult to spell.

23
00:05:49,616 --> 00:06:04,630
It has turned blue.

24
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:19,579
gave. I have it forever.

25
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:49,611
full. Thank you Rin-chan.

26
00:06:49,611 --> 00:07:34,611
Seen from Ori-chan's screen again.

27
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:49,644
Lacasta. What is good If you want to go out with me, I think you should confess.

28
00:07:49,644 --> 00:08:19,664
I think that courage is nice for girls, but I was shaken by the same person three times. It's a festival thing.

29
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:34,581
A case where a persistent man is disliked. A persistent man.

30
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:49,644
The guy who says he's dating because he likes it will certainly be there.

31
00:08:49,644 --> 00:09:04,629
Even if you double it, then maybe someone who will make an effort and confess when you've been refined. I'm not confident For example, I'm a little unsure of my body shape.

32
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:19,672
Then I'd like to go on a diet again and then go again.

33
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:34,528
I think so.

34
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:49,606
But what should I do? You just have to supplement it with something other than that.

35
00:09:49,606 --> 00:10:04,626
I don't like my face. For example, I have a salty face.

36
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:19,656
I can't do anything like a hand, but I can't do anything else.

37
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:34,530
What do you mean.

38
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:49,596
It's time to join forces with the dogs. Really.

39
00:10:49,596 --> 00:11:04,571
Sometimes I get out.

40
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:19,604
Where.

41
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:49,596
I'm worried. Is it a bug?

42
00:11:49,596 --> 00:12:04,603
It seems to be a bug. It's too ridiculous and contains several pieces.

43
00:12:04,603 --> 00:12:34,647
It's already past 1 o'clock and it's time to go to bed at the festival. Sneezing. I want to understand the song that I want to play some other game.

44
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:49,631
So I'll go the day after tomorrow and tomorrow I'll play some other game.

45
00:12:49,631 --> 00:13:04,622
Thank you for your support. I don't know how it was. Rinna person.

46
00:13:04,622 --> 00:13:19,605
A very informative foot mini festival.

47
00:13:19,605 --> 00:13:34,671
Because I think something about 2, somehow the persistent man and the man who gave up badly. If anyone thinks that they like festivals, I'd like to refer to them.

48
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:49,617
I don't know. What do you like about the town?

49
00:13:49,617 --> 00:14:04,606
Please refer to it.

50
00:14:04,606 --> 00:14:19,606
Nature. Let's finish around here and go home.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:15:14,679
Smiled.

52
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:29,720
It's a toilet.

53
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:44,688
I can't put it in.

54
00:15:44,688 --> 00:16:14,746
There was a time, and if there was enough momentum to ride, things wouldn't fall. I thought that the back hip circle could be done by releasing the hand by centrifugal force.

55
00:16:14,746 --> 00:16:29,749
When it went upside down, it fell normally and hit my head.

56
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:44,733
It didn't work. Don't believe in God's centrifugal force.

57
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:59,760
Probably, an incident happened that no one expected. Thank you for the first time.

58
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:14,693
Thank you very much. Thank you again for today. 8.

59
00:17:14,693 --> 00:17:29,758

So who would you be today? I would like to go with 4. Welcome back after a long time.

65
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:29,745

Even if you use the two letters that it is a user name, it is not at all. It's okay though.

112
00:31:31,701 --> 00:31:46,691
If you don't do something like the house you want to do. Then it's good at all. At home, summer colors, festivals, and other festivals.

113
00:31:46,691 --> 00:32:01,704
If you want to avoid the festival, please block it. It's okay at all Thank you.

Thank you. I hope you will get along well with me from now on. Thank you. Thank you yesterday.

130
00:36:01,722 --> 00:36:16,751
You're lying. I'm sorry if it's because of my mind, I don't think it's because of my mind.

131
00:36:16,751 --> 00:36:31,706
I've seen it many times. I said thank you.

132
00:36:31,706 --> 00:36:46,737
I saw it many times. Stop it and if the festival is serious, if you make a mistake, I don't remember me.

133
00:36:46,737 --> 00:37:01,709
Stop it, stop it now, really. No good.

134
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:16,685
Hatsumi-san, stop it. That's the nerd hated by that idol. I'm telling you to stop being strong.

135
00:37:16,685 --> 00:37:31,713
Write a lie. How can I not believe it?

136
00:37:31,713 --> 00:37:46,687
Thank you very much. Let's meet again tomorrow. Thank you to everyone for today, such as a channel registration instructor.
