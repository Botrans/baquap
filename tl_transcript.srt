00:00:48,401 --> 00:01:03,407
You might think it might have been the original. It may be originally.

4
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:18,389
You'll notice it really. When I noticed it with my baby.

5
00:01:18,389 --> 00:01:33,376
You will notice it. Barrehen Barrehen.

I've been mischievous.

12
00:03:33,436 --> 00:03:48,467
Nana-chan is the first when I feel sick when I come to Discord. I thought the person who came was cute.

13
00:03:48,467 --> 00:04:03,441
It's like this now, but I wonder if this side too.

14
00:04:03,441 --> 00:04:18,439
Because it is the site of the shrine maiden senior here.

15
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:33,408
I messed up with me. Like.

16
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:48,390

You may drink from here. Somehow ordinary bricks. Blackstone.

21
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:18,442
First of all, let's go by train because it's made of bricks. smilingly. The guy who wasn't under Tsukuba from 3.

22
00:06:18,442 --> 00:06:33,417
Don't say it's not blue. It looks like you guys are using it. You said something, why?

23
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:48,404
If you continue to use such emoji. It's kind of awkward to make it the color of this brick, but it's okay.

24
00:06:48,404 --> 00:07:03,410
For example. It feels bad.

25
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:18,423
It makes me wonder if it has any meaning.

26
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:33,418

Somehow everyone may be using various things like this. Don't say 9.

31
00:08:48,437 --> 00:09:03,439
It's pasta. When something happened that. It may not be good.

32
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:18,419
Sometimes it's refreshing to solve it in person.

33
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:33,443
If Pekora is doing as usual, do it as usual. But it may have been annoying.

34
00:09:33,443 --> 00:09:48,424
A little. I prayed.

35
00:09:48,424 --> 00:10:03,417
We will watch over with the same feeling, so everyone should watch over.

Chilled. Pororo.

42
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:18,421

Things break. It's happening with a bug.

53
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:55,015
I wonder if there will be any bugs if I use something from India now. I think it's better to report 2 that the Blue people are just delusional.

54
00:15:55,015 --> 00:16:25,026
I can't say anything yet. You should go to say. It's okay.

55

60
00:17:55,016 --> 00:18:10,032
I thought. Doesn't it have to be gymnastics?

61
00:18:10,032 --> 00:18:25,047
Like this. I'm done.

Did you tell me?

97
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:40,027
I'm pretty confident because I don't type in my own typing.

98
00:28:40,027 --> 00:28:55,986
I can point out mistakes.

99
00:28:55,986 --> 00:29:10,030

A little if there is no light in the middle. Even as it is.

117
00:34:42,924 --> 00:34:57,918
Even though. What is this mystery?

118
00:34:57,918 --> 00:35:27,963
Let's go back to Oct. Don't fall into the ditch in the water. I'm sorry for the jam. Who is a man?

119
00:35:27,963 --> 00:35:42,899
I was listening to people. Collect this.

120
00:35:42,899 --> 00:35:57,971
You can eat it.

121
00:35:57,971 --> 00:36:27,948
It's like this. But you can get out of here, so if you don't have to go to the entrance here, you can get out of here.

00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:12,974
Maybe it's okay. This look.

125
00:37:12,974 --> 00:37:27,948
Maybe it's a love call from Acton.

126
00:37:27,948 --> 00:37:42,956
I was in the middle of waiting. Ariel song.

127

If you want to go from yourself, you can.

Niigata Nishi I got frustrated.

139
00:41:42,935 --> 00:42:12,907

I even use a venture here, which is also cute.

141
00:42:27,944 --> 00:42:42,928
Even a little tea. Like.

142
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:57,970

00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:57,970
There is evidence that a chest was placed on this.

147
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:12,930
Often.

148
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:27,009
hamster. As much as I didn't know I shouldn't jump over it. To Subaru-chan.

149
00:44:27,009 --> 00:44:42,930
In the wall. I'm awake. I'm here yesterday.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:44:59,690
not enough.

151
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:14,767
I have an opinion. Unfortunately, it's also wheat.

152
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:29,759
It's just baked potatoes. If I had wheat.

153
00:45:29,759 --> 00:45:44,761
How can I find a place?

00:45:44,761 --> 00:45:59,760
Alright with this. Balloon pattern flows. nobody.

155
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:14,752
It looks like you can go over here.

156
00:46:14,752 --> 00:46:29,847
I wondered if I didn't have to come here, but I didn't want to make it here. Just a little over here.

157
00:46:29,847 --> 00:46:44,785
Chofu 2 small. Let's make it OK actor half.

158
00:46:44,785 --> 00:46:59,785
I like the half view here. Like.

159
00:46:59,785 --> 00:47:14,773
Is it all right with one? What is this?

160
00:47:14,773 --> 00:47:29,818
It doesn't make sense. The meaning of this grass placed as if it were meaningful.

161
00:47:29,818 --> 00:47:44,762
It definitely makes sense.

162
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:59,782
It's fun and it doesn't mean anything to pasta. I see this.

163
00:47:59,782 --> 00:48:14,779
That place. For example, change it.

164
00:48:14,779 --> 00:48:29,829
If you notice that you're doing this, it's going to be morning. It's already morning. It's a good place. I'm feeling it.

165
00:48:29,829 --> 00:48:44,764
It's a place like Tsurukawa.

166
00:48:44,764 --> 00:48:59,765
I'm curious.

167
00:48:59,765 --> 00:49:14,761
The fog is gone.
