This is it.

167
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:51,465
I jumped out. It sticks out. Someone with a sharp connection that sticks out.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:59:08,451
My sister is bad. Leave it.

169
00:59:08,451 --> 00:59:24,517
It's a flight that passed away when the connection was sticking out.

170
00:59:24,517 --> 00:59:38,453
Later, I'm busy right now.

171
00:59:38,453 --> 01:00:08,424
taxi. I am.

172
01:00:08,424 --> 01:00:23,473
It's difficult, isn't it? I'm a demon.

173
01:00:23,473 --> 01:00:38,414
This is it. Yes.

174
01:00:38,414 --> 01:00:53,482
Wash it. Heavy box. After all it is good. Busy busy.

175
01:00:53,482 --> 01:01:09,507
I didn't come when I thought about it. My neighbor's wife said she saw my husband in the park in February.

176
01:01:09,507 --> 01:01:24,511
I wonder if my dad's job is this milk, I'm sure. 1234.

177
01:01:24,511 --> 01:01:39,503
Push and.

178
01:01:39,503 --> 01:01:53,480
Why do you take this momentum? Something unpleasant.

179
01:01:53,480 --> 01:02:08,470
In orange.

180
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:23,499
this. I'm not paying.

181
01:02:23,499 --> 01:02:39,506
You can afford it.

182
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:54,510
It 's not me, it 's quake tomorrow. Earth Quake. can Cause damage and. I think I have to hide under my desk while I'm awake.

183
01:02:54,510 --> 01:03:08,493
Red star sound.

184
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:23,489
Baby okay. Pacific baby This is wrong, isn't it right?

185
01:03:23,489 --> 01:03:38,457
Chupachupa sound.

186
01:03:38,457 --> 01:03:53,499
Even if you put it on the floor, it won't make a slight movement. Star sound.

187
01:03:53,499 --> 01:04:08,486
This is it. The one that fell is the front.

188
01:04:08,486 --> 01:04:24,527
After all.

189
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:38,457
I have to go.

190
01:04:38,457 --> 01:05:08,487
What this is over.

191
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:23,481
It's easy at all. This is really me.

192
01:05:23,481 --> 01:05:38,490
If everyone was a baby, my uncle would raise it. Everyone is a baby.

193
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:53,492
Because everyone has Mom's the Word.

194
01:05:53,492 --> 01:06:08,471
I'm making coffee.

195
01:06:08,471 --> 01:06:23,489
Oh, wash this. I'm getting sleepy.

196
01:06:23,489 --> 01:06:39,531
If I didn't throw it into the sink as an addition, I would have become a baby-it's strange.

197
01:06:39,531 --> 01:06:54,526
It's decided by 4, but do it. I haven't done anything wrong.

198
01:06:54,526 --> 01:07:23,497
It's not fast to accumulate. I can't help but say goodbye.

199
01:07:23,497 --> 01:07:39,508
In romaji. 4 right? I wonder if this is right.

200
01:07:39,508 --> 01:07:54,513
Where do you put it?

201
01:07:54,513 --> 01:08:23,499
What? thus.

202
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:54,515
No mistakes are allowed. Seriously one-time price.

203
01:08:54,515 --> 01:09:08,499
It's impossible to get up.

204
01:09:08,499 --> 01:09:24,511
You shouldn't drink coffee or something, maybe. I think I'll do it quite a bit. The baby is waiting. Coffee doesn't work.

205
01:09:24,511 --> 01:09:38,485
What what what what what

206
01:09:38,485 --> 01:09:53,492
Don't ride anymore This is a different phone Is this right here?

207
01:09:53,492 --> 01:10:09,508
Asago is Yoshimoto. Detergent container.

208
01:10:09,508 --> 01:10:53,436
Ojaro.

209
01:10:53,436 --> 01:11:23,486
Why is the front so amazing?

210
01:11:23,486 --> 01:11:38,491
Is included.

211
01:11:38,491 --> 01:11:53,493
If I had to be the eldest son, what would I do now? now.

212
01:11:53,493 --> 01:12:23,482
Contipa.

213
01:12:23,482 --> 01:12:38,496
With sound.

214
01:12:38,496 --> 01:12:54,531
I don't have time to dig in, so here. I'm sure it's milk next.

215
01:12:54,531 --> 01:13:08,459
Make a decision.

216
01:13:08,459 --> 01:13:24,510
5 glasses of detergent here 123.

217
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:39,504
I said yesterday that I became a dad, but who is it? I'm a mom at all.

218
01:13:39,504 --> 01:13:54,518
I also wash myself carefully.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 01:14:11,584
Noda Why -5? It will recover after a plus.

220
01:14:11,584 --> 01:14:26,623
A cup falls from Sasaki to the floor. I don't like it. It's about here number 9, so I don't need this child here.

221
01:14:26,623 --> 01:14:41,625
I am. While saying such a thing, I will chupachupa the baby bottle. Coffee pipe.

222
01:14:41,625 --> 01:14:56,599
This isn't it.

223
01:14:56,599 --> 01:15:11,635
Livestock.

224
01:15:11,635 --> 01:15:26,555
what's this.

225
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:41,637
1. This is a crushed one.

226
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:56,640
I'm only interested in that. My baby is strong so milk is 90 °.

227
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:11,586
Request anything.

228
01:16:11,586 --> 01:16:41,632
Where are the points cut?

229
01:16:41,632 --> 01:16:56,599
I don't need it I don't need it.

230
01:16:56,599 --> 01:17:11,638
Baby You really like the narrow space, baby. I can't afford this stage.

231
01:17:11,638 --> 01:17:26,627
This is the only way to wash it.

232
01:17:26,627 --> 01:17:41,663
Separate setting.

233
01:17:41,663 --> 01:17:56,575
OK.

234
01:17:56,575 --> 01:18:11,597
It's milk. It's already hard. Eating Draco.

235
01:18:11,597 --> 01:18:26,651
This is still useless. Really.

236
01:18:26,651 --> 01:18:56,631
Ababa Baba. next. toilet.

237
01:18:56,631 --> 01:19:11,616
Jabjabu.

238
01:19:11,616 --> 01:19:26,585
It looks like it's out of the bath.

239
01:19:26,585 --> 01:19:41,541
Not you.

240
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:56,598
Yes please idol. Cotton finish.

241
01:19:56,598 --> 01:20:11,625
It was an old house that was difficult.

242
01:20:11,625 --> 01:20:26,596
After breaking through drowsiness. It's an orange triangle.

243
01:20:26,596 --> 01:20:41,663
I got it. I'm not in love with you.

244
01:20:41,663 --> 01:20:56,581
Kuwa Kids This.

245
01:20:56,581 --> 01:21:11,622
Wow this is sleepy and hungry and hard.

246
01:21:11,622 --> 01:21:56,562
Okara.

247
01:21:56,562 --> 01:22:26,613
Baby baby. Rice rice rice.

248
01:22:26,613 --> 01:22:41,636
I feel very drowsy.

249
01:22:41,636 --> 01:22:56,647
Ayabe diet.

250
01:22:56,647 --> 01:23:11,613
Which one is in it?

251
01:23:11,613 --> 01:23:26,621
It looks like it's in. It's not dirty, you sent it.

252
01:23:26,621 --> 01:23:41,635
What are you still drinking? There is.

253
01:23:41,635 --> 01:23:56,677
If it hurts that the baby bottle is dirty.

254
01:23:56,677 --> 01:24:11,612
It's dangerous to be restricted.

255
01:24:11,612 --> 01:24:26,605
I was warm.

256
01:24:26,605 --> 01:24:41,619
It 's milk, right? Oh.

257
01:24:41,619 --> 01:24:56,610
Take out hot water.

258
01:24:56,610 --> 01:25:11,620
Hey, it's not around here. body.

259
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:26,608
Don't fall. Than my younger brother who has no voice.

260
01:25:26,608 --> 01:25:41,600
The blue alone will wake you up. Is it rice?

261
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:56,658
I forgot. Alphard Thank you. It's a crazy story.

262
01:25:56,658 --> 01:26:11,629
Ummm. I was sleeping the other day.

263
01:26:11,629 --> 01:26:26,601
I can't talk while playing a compensation game. This story. I can't talk while playing games.

264
01:26:26,601 --> 01:26:41,637
Chupa Chupa Yaro.

265
01:26:41,637 --> 01:26:56,635
Only diapers are diapers.

266
01:26:56,635 --> 01:27:26,645
This is a one-shot game over for kids. I want Ryotsu to decrease.

267
01:27:26,645 --> 01:27:56,647
It's not me.

268
01:27:56,647 --> 01:28:26,627
The diaper I made.

269
01:28:26,627 --> 01:28:41,568
Powder Powder Powder. I can come.

270
01:28:41,568 --> 01:28:56,559
so.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 01:29:13,573
I wonder if the dirt will come off with me. You can wash this together.

272
01:29:13,573 --> 01:29:28,608
Is it here? No.

273
01:29:28,608 --> 01:29:43,516
hungry.

274
01:29:43,516 --> 01:29:58,579
Eat in the darkness. I replaced it. Ah sleepy sleepy.

275
01:29:58,579 --> 01:30:13,547
Good, good, good, good. There is something like that.

276
01:30:13,547 --> 01:30:28,629
Amazing mother simulator. Essential I don't know, but I'm raising a child.

277
01:30:28,629 --> 01:30:43,613
Laundry Childcare Cleaning Laundry.

278
01:30:43,613 --> 01:30:58,589
Because it leads to childcare neurosis, so don't choose this. this. It was really snappy.

279
01:30:58,589 --> 01:31:13,627
Please stop it. As soon as I get home from work, I do this in Fukuroi. What is this resurrection this.

280
01:31:13,627 --> 01:31:28,625
Work with an aloha shirt. Ranma 1/2. What do you want after that guy?

281
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:43,625
Put it in.

282
01:31:43,625 --> 01:32:13,634
If you're hungry, you can drink milk too.

283
01:32:13,634 --> 01:32:28,607
It's really 0/7 after that, so why is this?

284
01:32:28,607 --> 01:32:43,593
What is this?

285
01:32:43,593 --> 01:32:58,600
It's separate.

286
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:13,610
It's okay to eat something, no matter what you think.

287
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:43,626
3.4.

288
01:33:43,626 --> 01:33:58,563
Why did you move this?

289
01:33:58,563 --> 01:34:13,604
Four. I don't have one more.

290
01:34:13,604 --> 01:34:28,584
One more.

291
01:34:28,584 --> 01:34:43,596
What did you put in?

292
01:34:43,596 --> 01:34:58,527
surely.

293
01:34:58,527 --> 01:35:13,557
Not in English.

294
01:35:13,557 --> 01:35:28,614
As soon as this got drunk perfectly, the wash was dull and died. Because it's annoying. Yada doesn't even put money in the house.

295
01:35:28,614 --> 01:35:43,664
Really. What do you want?

296
01:35:43,664 --> 01:35:58,620
It's noisy. The inclination when throwing the little finger. You can see how good it is.

297
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:28,558
1.4. Lock.

298
01:36:28,558 --> 01:36:43,568
The stomach and toilet exploded. Apita or 9 houses.

299
01:36:43,568 --> 01:36:58,602
Apita. It's thin. What timing should I do? Thank you Welcome.

300
01:36:58,602 --> 01:37:13,562
Before I knew it.

301
01:37:13,562 --> 01:37:28,598
It swells about 600 million times in the belly. Do not know.

302
01:37:28,598 --> 01:37:43,591
Red Red Yellow Blue.

303
01:37:43,591 --> 01:37:58,541
Four.

304
01:37:58,541 --> 01:38:28,529
Four.

305
01:38:28,529 --> 01:38:43,583
Did I take all the swims?

306
01:38:43,583 --> 01:38:58,650
that. I heard you ate a box of logically popular food. I've never bought one either.

307
01:38:58,650 --> 01:39:13,602
I don't even eat Honnaka.

308
01:39:13,602 --> 01:39:28,562
It was close.

309
01:39:28,562 --> 01:39:43,526
mother.

310
01:39:43,526 --> 01:39:58,600
Do not be silly. Are you really this bastard?

311
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:13,595
I'm hungry. Toilet Toilet Toilet.

312
01:40:13,595 --> 01:40:43,582
Five. This is the one here.

313
01:40:43,582 --> 01:40:58,524
Noisy.

314
01:40:58,524 --> 01:41:13,604
I have to make milk because it's in until I say this.

315
01:41:13,604 --> 01:41:28,587
I'm not hungry yet.

316
01:41:28,587 --> 01:41:58,549
I don't have it, but it's dangerous.

317
01:41:58,549 --> 01:42:13,584
The cheek guy is a little old. It's early even if I get old.

318
01:42:13,584 --> 01:42:28,591
Already. What should I do?

319
01:42:28,591 --> 01:42:43,558
Sleepy sleepy. I'm tired of everything.

320
01:42:43,558 --> 01:43:13,523
your. pleasant.

321
01:43:13,523 --> 01:43:28,531
I'm hungry.

322
01:43:28,531 --> 01:43:43,581
What's hard to get home? It's still a diaper.

323
01:43:43,581 --> 01:43:58,588
I can still shed it. That's a twist.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 01:44:30,638
You have a great adventure today. I'm hungry.

325
01:44:30,638 --> 01:44:45,604
Purple This is the one I put here.

326
01:44:45,604 --> 01:45:00,509
How nice.

327
01:45:00,509 --> 01:45:15,615
Is this fun? I cleared it. Is it education?

328
01:45:15,615 --> 01:45:30,556
I'm still doing cleaning. It's like Luigi's Mansion. When I was a baby.

329
01:45:30,556 --> 01:45:45,592
It's different. Kuniyasu.

330
01:45:45,592 --> 01:46:15,557
It's flowing. sleepy.

331
01:46:15,557 --> 01:46:30,599
There is no song.

332
01:46:30,599 --> 01:46:45,506
First.

333
01:46:45,506 --> 01:47:00,583
The guy who plays at a difficult disco.

334
01:47:00,583 --> 01:47:15,577
Jjigae. I can't hear it with hot water.

335
01:47:15,577 --> 01:47:30,584
What's going on with this?

336
01:47:30,584 --> 01:47:45,568
What made you set this BGM? I want to know the most. It's going well.

337
01:47:45,568 --> 01:48:00,589
Did you go to the rice fields?

338
01:48:00,589 --> 01:48:15,593
Should be the last in this room.

339
01:48:15,593 --> 01:48:30,525
Abune.

340
01:48:30,525 --> 01:48:45,569
Don't talk in free BGM.

341
01:48:45,569 --> 01:49:00,559
8 more.

342
01:49:00,559 --> 01:49:15,569
There are eight.

343
01:49:15,569 --> 01:49:30,589
Are you? Not a baby.

344
01:49:30,589 --> 01:50:00,570
I'm over the president of Aiwa.

345
01:50:00,570 --> 01:50:15,566
I was about to be confused by BGM. FB.

346
01:50:15,566 --> 01:50:30,577
UFO Yanke. What kind of situation is America What is a baby?

347
01:50:30,577 --> 01:50:45,556
The sound of Ena now. What?

348
01:50:45,556 --> 01:51:00,637
The red disappeared. It's okay, but it feels like Father Pucci.

349
01:51:00,637 --> 01:51:30,551
Take off your pants. Ahaha.

350
01:51:30,551 --> 01:51:45,589
That's right, I bought it, I bought it.

351
01:51:45,589 --> 01:52:00,563
Eh, the time was really shortened.

352
01:52:00,563 --> 01:52:15,594
You're back. Don't you know? I don't know if the UFO is trying to get rid of it or not.

353
01:52:15,594 --> 01:52:30,512
What is it?

354
01:52:30,512 --> 01:52:45,568
Abune lyrics.

355
01:52:45,568 --> 01:53:00,583
Noah. Tip on the head.

356
01:53:00,583 --> 01:53:15,576
Hit. Why -17 pieces.

357
01:53:15,576 --> 01:53:30,545
A woman to be kidnapped. Baby kidnapped I'm sorry. Somewhere else it will be here.

358
01:53:30,545 --> 01:53:45,597
How did you do it? I'm going to tear it off with this kind of child. I'll have you become another child. How pretty you see.

359
01:53:45,597 --> 01:54:00,606
I'm lamimi, but it's okay, you see, I'll take you home. Who is it soon? It's not soup stock.

360
01:54:00,606 --> 01:54:15,586
It's an orange heart. folder.

361
01:54:15,586 --> 01:54:30,578
What was it now.

362
01:54:30,578 --> 01:55:00,603
Not enough.

363
01:55:00,603 --> 01:55:15,603
I really like the place.

364
01:55:15,603 --> 01:55:30,609
Don't let it float at all. Diaper grave. I'm hungry.

365
01:55:30,609 --> 01:56:00,579
I'm scared of the timing. Sea lion.

366
01:56:00,579 --> 01:56:15,524
Leave it.

367
01:56:15,524 --> 01:56:30,517
Wrong.

368
01:56:30,517 --> 01:56:45,614
worst. I can't eat it if I have it.

369
01:56:45,614 --> 01:57:00,560
Even though it's a UFO. I'm making a mistake again.

370
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:15,597
Goodbye, why don't you make it yourself?

371
01:57:15,597 --> 01:57:30,592
However, I don't want to drink hot water, so add milk yourself. If this is the case, you can do your best. I'll ask you, really stop, this is this. What is it, you too.

372
01:57:30,592 --> 01:57:45,590
It was hot water, so I added milk. I don't know what it means, but 7 is 0 days. I want to go to the bathroom right away.

373
01:57:45,590 --> 01:58:00,603
Shed.

374
01:58:00,603 --> 01:58:15,530
Ikuzo Yoshi. Absent.

375
01:58:15,530 --> 01:58:30,651
Ababa Baba.

376
01:58:30,651 --> 01:58:45,612
have mistaken. It's over. The finished baby bottle went somewhere.

377
01:58:45,612 --> 01:59:00,558
I was warm.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 01:59:32,543
UFO kidnapped.

379
01:59:32,543 --> 02:00:17,501
That wasn't the toilet, next.

380
02:00:17,501 --> 02:00:47,510
Akashi.

381
02:00:47,510 --> 02:01:02,501
From the cradle to the graveyard. My body turns 360 °, but this one.

382
02:01:02,501 --> 02:01:16,453
wash.

383
02:01:16,453 --> 02:01:32,527
It's erotic.

384
02:01:32,527 --> 02:01:47,516
I wonder if I slept in Bunt Genki. Baby powder where.

385
02:01:47,516 --> 02:02:01,458
Abune.

386
02:02:01,458 --> 02:02:17,516
Baby powder Seriously where. I don't have diapers.

387
02:02:17,516 --> 02:02:32,549
Baby pa.

388
02:02:32,549 --> 02:02:47,541
Ome This.

389
02:02:47,541 --> 02:03:02,512
Ship a stack car.

390
02:03:02,512 --> 02:03:16,493
Noshime.

391
02:03:16,493 --> 02:03:31,499
I can't get it, but it's the worst.

392
02:03:31,499 --> 02:03:46,455
This is it.

393
02:03:46,455 --> 02:04:17,522
This looks fun Bath time is so big that babies can't do it. It's not just about hot water chapping later. Baby is different. At this age, it's okay to put it in.

394
02:04:17,522 --> 02:04:32,530
Is this okay? Are you going.

395
02:04:32,530 --> 02:04:47,507
It dangerous. Because it got really dirty.

396
02:04:47,507 --> 02:05:01,446
why.

397
02:05:01,446 --> 02:05:16,498
I wonder if this is good. I don't think who it is. I wonder if it has become beautiful.

398
02:05:16,498 --> 02:05:31,448
It's different.

399
02:05:31,448 --> 02:05:47,537
After this. I wonder if it will flow.

400
02:05:47,537 --> 02:06:16,489
What's the difference?

401
02:06:16,489 --> 02:06:32,533
It was in. It's in, so let's put this in. I'm very sleepy.

402
02:06:32,533 --> 02:07:01,477
It's no good. It's okay.

403
02:07:01,477 --> 02:07:17,542
I wonder if it's still useless because it's bubbling.

404
02:07:17,542 --> 02:07:32,509
Somehow powder?

405
02:07:32,509 --> 02:07:47,554
This guy who ate Monkumon.

406
02:07:47,554 --> 02:08:02,513
Oh yeah yeah?

407
02:08:02,513 --> 02:08:17,566
I'll prepare a bath before I put my baby in.

408
02:08:17,566 --> 02:08:32,537
While Reina is chapochapo. Drowsiness.

409
02:08:32,537 --> 02:08:46,494
I'll put it in.

410
02:08:46,494 --> 02:09:01,488
Ah, it looks like it's beautiful.

411
02:09:01,488 --> 02:09:16,485
Sprinkle with baby powder.

412
02:09:16,485 --> 02:09:32,507
Meals in between. Why am I there?

413
02:09:32,507 --> 02:09:47,525
Drowsiness is approaching drowsiness. Because I have an old man.

414
02:09:47,525 --> 02:10:01,455
stop it.

415
02:10:01,455 --> 02:10:16,450
It's a toilet.

416
02:10:16,450 --> 02:10:31,491
I'm being kidnapped.

417
02:10:31,491 --> 02:11:01,486
you. Seriously you.

418
02:11:01,486 --> 02:11:17,515
Poop Poop Where did you throw it?

419
02:11:17,515 --> 02:12:02,527
Did it become? Baby cat already in hand. Not you.

420
02:12:02,527 --> 02:12:32,538
SUUMO Revenge is not my mother squeak Earth Quake 2 Earth Quake 2 Revenge.

421
02:12:32,538 --> 02:12:47,535
The next work Godzilla 3 is said to be this together. What does it mean to burn the heart of revenge?

422
02:12:47,535 --> 02:13:02,527
Yes, only meals this time. Green.

423
02:13:02,527 --> 02:13:17,507
Will you come too? That kind of.

424
02:13:17,507 --> 02:13:32,544
I'm not a master of this sound, maybe this generation. You can enter.

425
02:13:32,544 --> 02:14:01,453
Where.

426
00:00:00,000 --> 02:14:34,506
I dropped it at worst.

427
02:14:34,506 --> 02:14:49,504
Is sandwiched. He jumped into the screen.

428
02:14:49,504 --> 02:15:03,459
I was saved. Bread.

429
02:15:03,459 --> 02:15:18,484
What was it made of rubber? Hey hey.

430
02:15:18,484 --> 02:15:48,471
It's beautiful. There was powder.

431
02:15:48,471 --> 02:16:03,467
When the UFO comes out.

432
02:16:03,467 --> 02:16:18,497
It's awkward. next.

433
02:16:18,497 --> 02:16:33,488
I wonder if it took time for the water to enter.

434
02:16:33,488 --> 02:16:49,530
Welcome Mr. Akutsu. Because I'm not raising children, I can understand the cuteness of children.

435
02:16:49,530 --> 02:17:03,422
Great.

436
02:17:03,422 --> 02:17:18,482
Ah, I've been doing it for 2 hours. This is already. Is it about 2 hours to Kotomi Market?

437
02:17:18,482 --> 02:17:34,502
Commitment to clear. But what baby are you still using? It's not a real baby. That kind of setting.

438
02:17:34,502 --> 02:17:49,526
I'm glad I didn't have to worry. But if you have mama power. Are you okay? I wonder if there is something that seems okay.

439
02:17:49,526 --> 02:18:04,533
It's kind to children, or about this age. Dental approach firmly.

440
02:18:04,533 --> 02:18:19,561
That kind of mother simulator, because I got the first stage of the test as it was. Dyna Then it's like detergent.

441
02:18:19,561 --> 02:18:34,521
Let me drink milk, 80. It's not a beautiful woman. When Comment comes back, this is the bread of the future.

442
02:18:34,521 --> 02:18:49,547
From this time on, it's cute, it's cute, I want to do it. I wonder if it was done well.

443
02:18:49,547 --> 02:19:04,559
That's why it was a very wonderful game. If you want to be a mom, please go there. Thank you so much for all the poop. The bronze monkey who gave me a chat.

444
02:19:04,559 --> 02:19:19,595
13 still walks from Ai Saint Marc Reimu-san Angel Tale 3 Black Magic 3. OK Thank you.
