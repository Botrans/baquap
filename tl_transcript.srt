138
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:31,055
It's a come-from-behind victory.

139
01:43:31,055 --> 01:43:46,078
A miracle may happen.

140
01:43:46,078 --> 01:44:01,050
You're not crazy.

141
01:44:01,050 --> 01:44:16,097

146
01:47:31,054 --> 01:47:46,066
Unfortunately. The punishment game.

147
01:47:46,066 --> 01:48:16,061
And a video. To all of them.

148
01:48:16,061 --> 01:49:01,075
After all the game is erased.

149
01:49:01,075 --> 01:49:16,074

154
01:50:31,099 --> 01:50:46,094

155
01:50:46,094 --> 01:51:01,147
I don't know what to do.

156
01:51:01,147 --> 01:51:16,094

I want something sweet. I want to hear the one I thought of.

161
01:52:16,082 --> 01:52:31,111
I wish everyone wasn't happy with this.

162
01:52:31,111 --> 01:52:46,103
I wonder if I should go for a while. Let's go like that.

163
01:52:46,103 --> 01:53:16,031
in the park.

164
01:53:16,031 --> 01:53:31,078

Mature woman.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 01:55:03,025
gradually.

168
01:55:03,025 --> 01:55:18,024
There is no place where I am not lonely.

169
01:55:18,024 --> 01:55:33,059
You're alone. Without you.

170
01:55:33,059 --> 01:56:18,990
No no.

171
01:56:18,990 --> 01:56:33,060

172
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:48,083
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What is it? The current words were strong, but I'm worried now.

173
01:56:48,083 --> 01:57:03,057
What kind of time should I wake up? Closed school. How to listen to what HIKAKIN wants.

174
01:57:03,057 --> 01:57:18,050
It 's not an excuse, is n't it? Now Nishino Kana.

175
01:57:18,050 --> 01:57:48,051
I've been there. I don't have that you.

176
01:57:48,051 --> 01:58:03,056
If you like. Will you marry me?

177
01:58:03,056 --> 01:58:18,102
It's a memory, what's still moving? Who and how I'm sorry I was on the road now.

178
01:58:18,102 --> 01:58:33,112
It's a little heavy. You have the right to choose here as well.

179
01:58:33,112 --> 01:58:48,088
Where do you ask and why do you say that?

180
01:58:48,088 --> 01:59:03,076
This is a kanji that combines all of the last ones.

181
01:59:03,076 --> 01:59:18,010
that.

182
01:59:18,010 --> 01:59:48,061
I was thinking of saying it.

183
01:59:48,061 --> 02:00:03,057
But I'm going to the sea. I've always wanted to say that. Cat.

184
02:00:03,057 --> 02:00:18,115
Some are not elite.

185
02:00:18,115 --> 02:00:33,089
I think it's good. please marry me.

186
02:00:33,089 --> 02:00:48,004
From now on. I love you.

187
02:00:48,004 --> 02:01:18,048
Thank you. Miko Sakura.

188
02:01:18,048 --> 02:01:33,071
With this. Warm support. Thank you very much.

189
02:01:33,071 --> 02:01:48,106
We were dating. Being dating.

190
02:01:48,106 --> 02:02:03,111
First every day. If I bring anything back, I'm dating another half. It's kind of ectopic.

191
02:02:03,111 --> 02:02:18,087
So bring it a little.

192
02:02:18,087 --> 02:02:33,069
I confirmed the value of Mishima station and confirmed it. you know what.

193
02:02:33,069 --> 02:03:03,060
I can't live without you. Will you marry me?

194
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:33,076
This is surely this, isn't it?

195
02:03:33,076 --> 02:03:48,153
File playback. L'Occitane.

196
02:03:48,153 --> 02:04:03,001
that.

197
02:04:03,001 --> 02:04:33,030
I was thinking of saying it. I'm going to go big.

198
02:04:33,030 --> 02:04:48,071
I was thinking. Cat. There is still more.

199
02:04:48,071 --> 02:05:03,084
Some are not elite. I wish you were there. I'm thinking.

200
02:05:03,084 --> 02:05:18,012
please marry me.

201
02:05:18,012 --> 02:05:33,076
This is the one who stopped. Mario Kart.

202
02:05:33,076 --> 02:05:48,045
Compared to Yamato at all. This is the elite's first sorry wait a minute.

203
02:05:48,045 --> 02:06:03,055
As expected that.

204
02:06:03,055 --> 02:06:18,109
Two episodes that are not on the 10th floor.

205
02:06:18,109 --> 02:06:33,091
I want luck.

206
02:06:33,091 --> 02:07:18,060
Why Google's color is a delightful place service scene.

207
02:07:18,060 --> 02:07:33,057
I'd like to deliver it separately from 23:00 at work.

208
02:07:33,057 --> 02:07:48,086
I would like to see two episodes together at 23:00 of the cat. From 23:00.

209
02:07:48,086 --> 02:08:03,093
I'm thinking. Really today.

210
02:08:03,093 --> 02:08:18,070
I want to do something that allows viewer participation, so I downloaded it. I also have a voice actor, Vegeta. I thought it was.

211
02:08:18,070 --> 02:08:33,050
Stage 10. I'm stopping it.

212
02:08:33,050 --> 02:08:48,049
I've never done it. That's fine, but that's fine.

213
02:08:48,049 --> 02:09:03,104
I'm stabbed at 23:00 and it feels like a god or a metamorphosis will come due to a bad time in Kyoto.

214
02:09:03,104 --> 02:09:18,094
I'm thinking about doing it after that. Let's do something. Nyan.

215
02:09:18,094 --> 02:09:33,070
I wondered if I could do it. I'm thinking of doing it in kanji. Thank you. In terms of promotion.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 02:09:50,137
Doing something like a questionnaire.

217
02:09:50,137 --> 02:10:05,120
There is also a questionnaire.

218
02:10:05,120 --> 02:10:20,109
That cat's questionnaire Yokota I'm glad if you answer, I'll fill it on the 31st. It's still very late, but I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

219
02:10:20,109 --> 02:10:35,124
I captivated Pleasure. Participatory participation does not occur.
