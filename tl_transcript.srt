1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,149
Of Doctor First Green Friend.

2
00:00:30,149 --> 00:01:15,181
I don't know about team battles. Toyama Prefecture.

3
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:30,107
What is a pattern?

4
00:01:30,107 --> 00:01:45,243
Are you doing your best? India.

5
00:01:45,243 --> 00:02:00,051
Good.

6
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:15,143
Is delicious. Ashiashiashiashiashiashi. I'm sure there is.

7
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:30,123
I don't want to live here.

8
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:45,145
Even though a newcomer came with much effort.

9
00:02:45,145 --> 00:03:00,109
stay.

10
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:30,168
Like the enemy of Ultraman.

11
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:45,123
Boss get it fast.

12
00:03:45,123 --> 00:04:00,115
Is anyone wrong?

13
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:15,148
still alive. Umezawa Dental.

14
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:30,220
I have to go to the final. I'm looking forward to today's strongest deciding match.

15
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:45,159
It seems to be done by hand. It's about 8 to 17:30.

16
00:04:45,159 --> 00:05:15,103
Show me beyond me. If you want to be 10 people.

17
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:30,076
It's a narrow gate.

18
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:45,136
Seems to do it. You seem to do it.

19
00:05:45,136 --> 00:06:00,103
Is it over? There is a highlight.

20
00:06:00,103 --> 00:06:15,074
I'm a long time ago.

21
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:30,143
Guardial There are quite a few highlights.

22
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:45,102
OK so good. I'll do it.

23
00:06:45,102 --> 00:07:00,144
It's pretty good.

24
00:07:00,144 --> 00:07:15,145
I'll admit you.

25
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:30,146
Because it remained. Congratulations on the stage.

26
00:07:30,146 --> 00:08:00,113
that. Where was it?

27
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:15,107
Even though it started.

28
00:08:15,107 --> 00:08:30,185
Because there is only one winner. You dropped it because it's hard to recognize. I'm not good at it.

29
00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:45,127
If you're not good at it.

30
00:08:45,127 --> 00:09:00,123
Why don't you do that.

31
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:15,138
Polishing stage. I died in an instant.

32
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:30,162
When it's time to take your enemies, take them.

33
00:09:30,162 --> 00:09:45,127
By the way, the picture is pretty good.

34
00:09:45,127 --> 00:10:15,045
Yes.

35
00:10:15,045 --> 00:10:30,179
Wear the same dolphin.

36
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:45,130
The ancestor. I'm sorry for you guys.

37
00:10:45,130 --> 00:11:00,141
I always lose as soon as I lose. It's like a team bug. It seems that the shoulders become stronger when one of them enters.

38
00:11:00,141 --> 00:11:45,129
It's a system that you'll get fired if you fall, so you can't join until the final.

39
00:11:45,129 --> 00:12:00,056
Dolphin.

40
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:15,127
But it won't fall here.

41
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:45,171
What is it? Can you do it?

42
00:12:45,171 --> 00:13:00,050
impossible.

43
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:30,414
OK so good. But it's not like that.

44
00:13:30,414 --> 00:13:45,182
here.

45
00:13:45,182 --> 00:14:30,361
OK. According to the results, you should wait for the punch because you are not yet in 16 servings.

46
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:45,121
I can't do 5.

47
00:14:45,121 --> 00:15:00,259
I love you. Nights Nights.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,292
The proportion of the Tenma stage has increased, because I'm steadily being there.

49
00:00:30,292 --> 00:00:45,142
If you hit. Support the previous person.

50
00:00:45,142 --> 00:01:00,260
Right left. After that, if the crocodile does not have an accident.

51
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:15,088
Go forward with a horse.

52
00:01:15,088 --> 00:01:30,091
Are you coming or okay?

53
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:45,129
Ice cream completely ice cream.

54
00:01:45,129 --> 00:02:00,061
Do your best.

55
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:15,098
It's really related.

56
00:02:15,098 --> 00:02:45,095
Insanely good pants.

57
00:02:45,095 --> 00:03:00,121
I'm going now.

58
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:15,107
Nakano kaeru.

59
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:30,115
It's amazing I'm really in good shape today.

60
00:03:30,115 --> 00:04:15,095
I know a game called Civilization. Something. It seems to be a simulation game.

61
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:30,091
I like that kind of thing.

62
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:45,146
Tundra.

63
00:04:45,146 --> 00:05:00,115
That's right. What is the most famous? League of.

64
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:15,132
Please do something like a bad egg.

65
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:45,113
Action 2 was the first time I even heard it.

66
00:05:45,113 --> 00:06:30,128
If you install that game.

67
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:45,131
I'm getting some notifications. Stick Civilization 3 is expensive.

68
00:06:45,131 --> 00:07:15,099
Pee at Ganda store.

69
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:45,085
Which one seems to be stronger if it stabilizes.

70
00:07:45,085 --> 00:08:00,098
If that can be easily put in.

71
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:15,135
I will be in charge.

72
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:30,043
Dolphin.

73
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:45,086
After all. It will survive.

74
00:08:45,086 --> 00:09:00,150
Since there are 15 people, there is no team battle.

75
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:45,130
Do you want to go with me?

76
00:09:45,130 --> 00:10:15,082
Such.

77
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:30,120
Let's go calmly and calmly.

78
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:45,086
It's okay

79
00:10:45,086 --> 00:11:00,143
Subaru Ebina.

80
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:15,159
The subordinates are the surviving subordinates. Do you see loans such as stock prices?

81
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:30,138
Is there Yamada? Are you all okay? But show me where you can go.

82
00:11:30,138 --> 00:12:00,051
It's amazing.

83
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:15,059
ice cream.

84
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:30,125
Protect, protect, protect, protect.

85
00:12:30,125 --> 00:13:00,114
If you have a small shell, you're deciding on red and blue now.

86
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:30,140
If you lose your physical condition early.

87
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:45,093
Do you want to cover it? It's a matter of inheriting the will.

88
00:13:45,093 --> 00:14:00,114
It's 77 minutes, right? 2/74. 2/7.

89
00:14:00,114 --> 00:14:15,116
Then I'll ask. I asked for it. This is an insanely powerful game.

90
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:30,132
Mama Shinji Newcomers and newcomers I saw Newcomers.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,045
As expected.

92
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:30,136
Crushing each other Nakano. Horse racing is stable.

93
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:45,099
The sky can't go home either. Auto agreement.

94
00:00:45,099 --> 00:01:15,125
A slow effect with no way. In some cases.

95
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:30,094
Can't you reach it? Didn't you say anything yet? Did you do it?

96
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:45,153
I'm awake as a woman.

97
00:01:45,153 --> 00:02:00,134
I have to live for a while. That's right, I have a part-time job. It's painful 10,000 to 1.

98
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:15,077
What are we doing?

99
00:02:15,077 --> 00:02:45,123
You have the ability.

100
00:02:45,123 --> 00:03:00,107
I wanted to see the current movement.

101
00:03:00,107 --> 00:03:15,120
It's strong even if it's sprinkled. If you always do it. Today is my birthday.

102
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:45,107
There are about 5 people.

103
00:03:45,107 --> 00:04:00,081
Oguri friend. This game is too easy.

104
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:45,098
It's a little difficult.

105
00:04:45,098 --> 00:05:00,146
This is a little difficult, isn't it? From the outside.

106
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:15,142
It's difficult.

107
00:05:15,142 --> 00:05:30,184
Is this over? I don't know.

108
00:05:30,184 --> 00:05:45,115
What should i do?

109
00:05:45,115 --> 00:06:00,156
Difficult 7. I thought the factory was dead, but it was surprising.

110
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:15,121
Everyone fell because it was difficult.

111
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:30,095
The far right.

112
00:06:30,095 --> 00:07:00,088
Hashiko Gundam 10 ports. Hashikko.

113
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:45,128
The pattern is powerful.

114
00:07:45,128 --> 00:08:00,162
Mama This is what it is.

115
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:30,131
I'll do it, Green Friend. Please buy it next time.

116
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:45,129
I'm not standing on TM 1000.

117
00:08:45,129 --> 00:09:15,101
It's a team battle. I'm taking a bath when it's dangerous.

118
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:30,106
The movement here is smooth.

119
00:09:30,106 --> 00:10:00,134
Blue haze. Green friend is dead.

120
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:30,119
I inherited the will of my friend.

121
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:45,084
It's still like this at all. Matsutomo I don't want to fall.

122
00:10:45,084 --> 00:11:15,086
The right side is the right side where you can go to the right.

123
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:30,085
Leave it to me.

124
00:11:30,085 --> 00:11:45,152
Roadster spirit liner with Ono Buddhist beads.

125
00:11:45,152 --> 00:12:00,182
Firefighting games are heavy. I understand that I am the most capable.

126
00:12:00,182 --> 00:12:15,281
There are times when I'm vacant.

127
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:30,228
Move frequently.

128
00:12:30,228 --> 00:12:45,269
You're doing it. What is it?

129
00:12:45,269 --> 00:13:00,270
I think it's a pretty good one. Performance. I'm jerky.

130
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:15,214
Even so, it's excellent.

131
00:13:15,214 --> 00:13:30,246
Depas. Jump if you jump.

132
00:13:30,246 --> 00:13:45,048
Depas.

133
00:13:45,048 --> 00:14:00,278
Shirokuma on stage. Do you want to put in one shot? This blue.

134
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:15,051
vehicle.

135
00:14:15,051 --> 00:14:30,129
The water is amazing high level high level.

136
00:14:30,129 --> 00:15:00,111
Are you going to the final race?

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:00,149
5 ice cream.

138
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:15,136
Show me the good points.

139
00:01:15,136 --> 00:01:30,192
That area is already here.

140
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:45,140
Annoying.

141
00:01:45,140 --> 00:02:00,107
That's right, we all want to go to the final.

142
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:15,100
It's very strange.

143
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:30,073
what time is it.

144
00:02:30,073 --> 00:02:45,161
If you did a waterfall rise custom. Because it falls to 17.

145
00:02:45,161 --> 00:03:30,116
Who is the map here? There are quite a few at the end.

146
00:03:30,116 --> 00:04:00,116
It's strong. It 's amazing, it 's amazing.

147
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:30,112
It's amazing.

148
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:45,219
There is no one who can do it like this.

149
00:04:45,219 --> 00:05:15,138
It's a team battle. Life will be cut off.

150
00:05:15,138 --> 00:07:00,139
Akashi Akashi.

151
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:15,164
Flowers before being flipped. What is Tama Keep?

152
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:30,104
It was an overwhelming victory.

153
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:45,119
I love you, not a green flat.

154
00:07:45,119 --> 00:08:15,164
You know.

155
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:30,088
Tenma style jump club.

156
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:45,138
It's a little disturbing.

157
00:08:45,138 --> 00:09:00,101
I was blown away because of it.

158
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:45,122
Let's do our best. I'm you, you're a flower.

159
00:09:45,122 --> 00:10:00,159
I don't know who makes holes from the beginning.

160
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:45,120
Itchy nose.

161
00:10:45,120 --> 00:11:00,092
Let's go slowly.

162
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:30,130
How reliable is the match with you?

163
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:45,127
I don't have a house.

164
00:11:45,127 --> 00:12:00,134
Ice had a vast land of ice.

165
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:15,145
Even if you catch a star. In Toyoake.

166
00:12:15,145 --> 00:12:30,105
I think that I want to do it. But thank you for your hard work.

167
00:12:30,105 --> 00:12:45,138
It's different from 3 places. Thank you very much. I'll finish today from 17:00.

168
00:12:45,138 --> 00:13:00,134
The eastern team is sweaty, but Robert also comes out.

169
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:15,063
Thank you very much.
