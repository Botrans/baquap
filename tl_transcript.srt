1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:12:45,195
Really.

2
00:12:45,195 --> 00:13:45,119
Take over the baton.

3
00:13:45,119 --> 00:14:00,150
I would be grateful if you could retweet if you could add it to the front.

4
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:15,098
Did he forget?

5
00:14:15,098 --> 00:14:30,106
I like it. Please wait.

6
00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:45,117
That time lost time. But I took it first and walked.

7
00:14:45,117 --> 00:15:00,114
The octane was visible in the distance, but a little.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,112
Not much this time.

9
00:00:15,112 --> 00:00:30,114
I wonder if I should touch the baton. I had time.

10
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:45,154
A little difference from the second floor of Yuka. I thought.

11
00:00:45,154 --> 00:01:00,120
Because there is a wonderful gap space. Who should clean up this room on the first floor?

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:15,139
I wonder if I should replace this.

13
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:30,115
Would you like to replace this once? I met you next time.

14
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:45,121
Let's get it as a salary. Something like gravel.

15
00:01:45,121 --> 00:02:00,135
I thought. I'll do it. For the time being, my own. What only that place.

16
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:15,150
That Wither Suke's head is scheduled for Octane. What is my salary?

17
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:30,135
Scissors I have money, but is that okay? It's cute for the time being.

18
00:02:30,135 --> 00:02:45,088
This public bath. I was wondering how much I should prepare.

19
00:02:45,088 --> 00:03:00,108
After all it starts from the beginning. I was caught when it was dangerous. It was dangerous.

20
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:30,128
Syrup Starbucks. I didn't bring vermicelli.

21
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:45,117
I don't want that much.

22
00:03:45,117 --> 00:04:00,124
Pistolphin.

23
00:04:00,124 --> 00:04:15,162
Maybe a little more. That's right, that's right.

24
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:30,102
By Tamushi. I wonder if I can press it with this.

25
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:45,134
It's been 5 minutes already. Time police.

26
00:04:45,134 --> 00:05:00,113
I wonder if this is the case.

27
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:15,115
Because it is a hot water supply room.

28
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:30,047
have mistaken.

29
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:45,100
I regret that I made it with ordinary blocks. Did you want to make a little?

30
00:05:45,100 --> 00:06:00,119
Come on with this. I made an outer frame in light blue.

31
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:15,126
Make a fool of this and this.

32
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:30,081
Try it. Wait a minute. Put this away.

33
00:06:30,081 --> 00:07:00,155
Professional. Of Otaru.

34
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:15,110
It's just that. bathroom.

35
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:30,120
Even though it's cute, this is 102.

36
00:07:30,120 --> 00:08:00,121
What do you do now? What do you do now? I told you I don't need it, that's a lie.

37
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:15,139
Calm down for the time being.

38
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:45,100
It's hard.

39
00:08:45,100 --> 00:09:00,105
recovery. Riddle. I can still dance.

40
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:15,127
I'm still there.

41
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:30,039
Foreo.

42
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:45,105
I wish I had done this. Because the one you are using is a meeting. I think this was better.

43
00:09:45,105 --> 00:10:00,094
I saw it because the side-opening type is cute. I thought.

44
00:10:00,094 --> 00:10:45,090
The ceiling has a little heart.

45
00:10:45,090 --> 00:11:00,130
What is Mazda? Signboard.

46
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:15,091
It's not Akari.

47
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:30,146
Make a sign. I made it to a man and stopped.

48
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:45,133
Maybe I should have made it a pine tree.

49
00:11:45,133 --> 00:12:15,128
Where are the trap doors that I made so many? Nami-chan's day of the week.

50
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:30,130
toilet. Smoker. Do you want a smoker?

51
00:12:30,130 --> 00:13:00,085
with this. Put another one.

52
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:15,045
It helps.

53
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:30,122
Ah, that's right. This is a blind spot. that's true. You can't do that.

54
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:45,120
I thought. Yakult.

55
00:13:45,120 --> 00:14:15,119
I wonder if I can still use it if I keep a cat. Over here.

56
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:30,104
It feels bad if it sticks out.

57
00:14:30,104 --> 00:15:00,111
Yes. Okay. Why do you get tea?

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,110
I've been here for a while.

59
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:30,119
Half block. That's around here.

60
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:45,117
See you later. I didn't have that time.

61
00:00:45,117 --> 00:01:00,161
I want to make it. calm down.

62
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:15,122
Because it is a private dispatch, I should work after all.

63
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:30,146
Should I make it a staircase?

64
00:01:30,146 --> 00:01:45,122
It's cute, so a little refrigerator.

65
00:01:45,122 --> 00:02:00,126
who is it. But it's work.

66
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:15,063
faucet.

67
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:30,121
Water Water Water.

68
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:45,090
Muto Tomu.

69
00:02:45,090 --> 00:03:00,154
But I don't feel sorry for it. I haven't had time to say hello at all.

70
00:03:00,154 --> 00:03:15,130
Don't be in a hurry. What should I do?

71
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:30,089
Around here. lost.

72
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:45,126
Arcana Let's say I've become a little actor.

73
00:03:45,126 --> 00:04:00,088
Bookshelf. I wonder if there are more.

74
00:04:00,088 --> 00:04:15,046
Tractor. 8.

75
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:30,140
A little forgotten. I wonder if I just don't use it.

76
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:45,134
Will it be in time? I feel like I'll be in time.

77
00:04:45,134 --> 00:05:00,106
It's slack. Because I made it with this.

78
00:05:00,106 --> 00:05:15,120
I took it like shit.

79
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:30,132
The refrigerator has become a bit like a food storage. There is a name.

80
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:45,107
Someone like me in the fridge. What about the refrigerator? Begged.

81
00:05:45,107 --> 00:06:15,131
It can be defeated just by losing the edge of the house.

82
00:06:15,131 --> 00:06:30,119
I want this. So can't you put it?

83
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:45,103
A little more around here.

84
00:06:45,103 --> 00:07:00,140
It's too hot. Of green tea 2.

85
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:15,054
this.

86
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:30,037
Can you go

87
00:07:30,037 --> 00:07:45,111
Floor replacement.

88
00:07:45,111 --> 00:08:00,164
I don't know what color the wallpaper will be around here and there. Station.

89
00:08:00,164 --> 00:08:15,146
Yours coming soon. This will soon be a rainy castle.

90
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:30,126
Make it half.

91
00:08:30,126 --> 00:09:15,061
please stop. It hurts.

92
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:30,045
what is it.

93
00:09:30,045 --> 00:10:15,132
Water Water. Half block.

94
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:30,128
What's going on?

95
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:45,045
thus.

96
00:10:45,045 --> 00:11:00,140
Right in the middle. How about a child?

97
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:15,122
Tsukimino.

98
00:11:15,122 --> 00:11:30,118
I was too worried here. Something like this.

99
00:11:30,118 --> 00:11:45,123
I still have a surplus, so I want to use it.

100
00:11:45,123 --> 00:12:15,109
I have a desire to get up with him. The rest is already so.

101
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:30,127
But I feel like I heard the voice of Mr. Enderman.

102
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:45,142
Such a thing. I want to go to my sister Kin-chan I asked for your help. Is this a drawback?

103
00:12:45,142 --> 00:13:00,157
Baton Touch Nome-chan's in everyone's summary column. Yes.
