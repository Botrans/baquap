22

It's hard to line up a huge amount, so do your best. By the way, in my case, if it's 128, I think it'll be 16 and LINE.

42
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:30,238
16 9 was fine, but it's still 128. If you think about it, that's right. I'm sorry, thank you. LINE itself can be redrawn, so I will redraw it by 16 a little later.

43
00:11:30,238 --> 00:11:45,144
Mr. Sushineko Do you have any good skills from the civil engineering work supervisor? It's not closed so you can fix it. 16 each. KTK 3 Vehicle Phone.

thank you. Musashino Thank you for being cute.

46
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:30,163
I'm going to start FPS with a lot of influence from 30, but what game is recommended.

47
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:45,161
That's what I recommend FPS's recommendation It depends on what you want to do and what you want to do. Doridre duce I want to have fun.

48
00:12:45,161 --> 00:13:00,189
Mega FPS First if you want to get better. You had better go over there. That's COD.

49
00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:15,142
If it's water to learn that way of fighting in Rio, it's better to go there if it means to learn that way of fighting FPS in general.

50
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:30,134
If you want to have fun with battle OK, you can go to Avex suddenly. That's why I'll do medium FPS. When I feel like I'm having fun, I'll take the weight to that place.

51
00:13:30,134 --> 00:13:45,159
That's right, erotic story personal. I recommend it, but surprisingly, I have FPS practice with L4. How to keep the distance from and how to cover. Before that, how to do M.

52
00:13:45,159 --> 00:14:00,157
That game is also a kettle. Headshot You should aim for it. If you give it up, you will get better in that sense. What should I really say?

53
00:14:00,157 --> 00:14:15,142
There are many things you can learn through co-op play. Yup. Color L 4 Cooling may be recommended. The consciousness of Team K may reach.

54
00:14:15,142 --> 00:14:30,139
But it's easy to get in. It's easy to get into my head because there is a team deathmatch because it opens early. You say you can shoot a lot.

55
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:45,144
I'm also saying that I should go to csgo suddenly. After all, if it matches, you'll hit someone who is close to you, so you don't have to worry about that.

56
00:14:45,144 --> 00:15:00,151
COD isn't that weird yet, because there are times when you can win in the sense that it's fun, that game. csgo is apt.

57
00:15:00,151 --> 00:15:15,108
It's almost impossible to win a fluke. It may be good to be aware of that.

58
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:30,108
Well, after all. If you want to have fun, I think that if you can move to some extent, the fun will be doubled.

59
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:45,130
L 4 D Recommended? Up to L 4 D In the front, I'm a little proud of the player town, so I feel like I have friends. Soul scud.

Bookmarks Bookmarks are somehow because there are people. I think God is fine. Talkov is that way.

61
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:15,134
I want to do it relatively, but I can't do this with a stab = I'm not allowed to do it. Even match shutters will do it mainly. There is also Avex.

62
00:16:15,134 --> 00:16:30,170
Well, Apex is also FPS, but that's kind of common. Premier It may change a little because of which FPS you do first. But personally.

63
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:45,149
I personally like it, but I want you to do it. In that sense, I think Avex is easy to enter now.

64
00:16:45,149 --> 00:17:00,118
There are many people doing it, so there is a lot of information on how to capture it. It's also easy to hear. So in that sense, it's good to have played a game with a large population.

65
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:15,089
The safest or recommended pattern for beginners. After all, one delicious thing is a little bit of steak.

66
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:30,212
There is there. I don't care at all suddenly, so I'll do a plabe once in a while. I think it's okay.

67
00:17:30,212 --> 00:17:45,157
Is it like that? Well, it's free, so it might be easier to play. You can say that you quit because it didn't fit.

68
00:17:45,157 --> 00:18:00,150
Well, let's play a game with many people like that. It's a semi and BF is fun, but I'm sure he will come out if he wants information on Navi F 6.

69
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:15,126
Thank you for the fastest scaffolding in Wild Minecraft. EXE 3 Grilled rice balls are torn off and I want to take a look.

70
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:30,179
And it wasn't meaningful, and sometimes I was told that it was cut because I had a strong tone, but it wasn't cut at all. It seems that even the current way of saying that it's not cut at all seems to be cut, but it's crazy.

71
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:45,141
seriously. There are times when people say that they are cut off just by their tone.

72
00:18:45,141 --> 00:19:00,157
Even so, I would say if I run out. I didn't know that in the countryside.

73
00:19:00,157 --> 00:19:15,101
But somewhere. Is it already? I don't know the house.

74
00:19:15,101 --> 00:19:30,125
Because it's not really beautiful. It's often said that it looks like it's cut. I wonder if the delivery will be cut off.

75
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:45,151
I wonder if something can be cut to that extent in the first place. what about.

76
00:19:45,151 --> 00:20:00,131
I don't know.

77
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:15,123
No, but it's true that it's an image of something like that.

78
00:20:15,123 --> 00:20:30,127
I'm reading the comments now. Ah, but it may be that it will cool down before it runs out.

79
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:45,116
I'm angry that it's not outside the delivery. take easy. It looks like a kitchen sickness, but this one.

80
00:20:45,116 --> 00:21:00,123
I'm tired of the car. Somehow suddenly.

81
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:15,188
I don't have a little blood in my head, but there are times when I wonder why I say that, but it's annoying to think that it's more than a certain amount and why I say that kind of thing. Something like this, something like this.

82
00:21:15,188 --> 00:21:30,107
Stupid. I say it's calm or it gets cold. I wonder why I was angry at this.

83
00:21:30,107 --> 00:21:45,154
It doesn't make sense. It's just like that. Suddenly I was thinking.

84
00:21:45,154 --> 00:22:00,087
I don't like it. When you go to a certain line. So in that sense, something.

85
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:15,195
Suddenly, I was strong at the end of the word. I wonder if the rice was strong. Originally, 5 tails were strong because it was the default. Maybe I'm angry because it's quiet, but maybe.

86
00:22:15,195 --> 00:22:30,129
Sometimes it seems like I've stopped thinking so suddenly. Occasionally it is. However, it is the default that is strong in garbage.

87
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:45,132
It's the default that has a strong tone. I'm not angry. It 's strong. What was the original reason for making me misunderstand something? So think this is the default.

88
00:22:45,132 --> 00:23:00,131
I'm not angry. Because it feels like. It might be a purple 3 cactus guy.

89
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:15,149

91

00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:30,129
I like it, I like it, I like it, it's good, isn't it? It's still cute, isn't it? Stop the show. I'll do it during the time when my nephew can see it. It 's okay, this is the garage. The program will change from today.

125
00:32:30,129 --> 00:32:45,124
Late night program. The last one is also a midnight version. In many ways. You can't show it.

126
00:32:45,124 --> 00:33:00,153
I wrote it, so don't worry, please take a look. pump. Mr. Opto.

127
00:33:00,153 --> 00:33:15,118
Spa Shiva. Thank you for the late Mr. Tenka Shiba for Mr. Pattern.

128
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:30,154
Torimaru Opposition is an electric shop. Thank you Pictlogica, Android seems to come out when you become a member. arx 033.

129
00:33:30,154 --> 00:33:45,139
Left / right change Depth I'm going to work. Thank you for your hard work. Micra 4 Impress. Scaffolding height.

130
00:33:45,139 --> 00:34:00,134
I think it's pretty good on the red map of the Netherrack, so I recommend it. That's right, I understand the sentence. Thank you for the change house. It was dangerous to forget.

131
00:34:00,134 --> 00:34:15,156
I don't play card games for the dead, I play card games on TV. I was really doing it with Septo.

132
00:34:15,156 --> 00:34:30,104
I used to do it. I haven't done it for a while now, but it's really early. The first and second color. I was doing it until I got out.

133
00:34:30,104 --> 00:34:45,183
You were talking about a lie Culdcept. Say I really liked it.

134
00:34:45,183 --> 00:35:00,169
No, how far did Shadowverse go? The Netherworld Elf was out. Wasn't it? I remember.

135
00:35:00,169 --> 00:35:15,144
I don't know when I'm a little stronger. card. Shadowverse card. But how much was the old one.

136
00:35:15,144 --> 00:35:30,123
I know until the advent. I also know Darkness Evolve. Of the gods.

137
00:35:30,123 --> 00:35:45,136
What the gods read this in the darkness. Well, I may not have consulted with the store or the south yet. Bahamut I'm doing ice, so it's been a long time ago.

138
00:35:45,136 --> 00:36:00,162
I went to the master, but there wasn't that at that time. It's still that master. These days. I'm sure it's there now.

139
00:36:00,162 --> 00:36:15,144
It 's not rolling, tomorrow 's Gramas, it 's the red one. At that time, I wasn't here yet and that master. Something like that top 123456.

140
00:36:15,144 --> 00:36:30,133
It's already a point formula. Because there was no massage lady. But I think it was a game that would go up if you were honest with the master. Dentistry.

141
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:45,105
The point goes down, but it's crazy. Donald Silver or Gold, which is what we now call Platinum. It's going down today but it doesn't seem to go from 4 to gold.

142
00:36:45,105 --> 00:37:00,140
So if I did my best, I could go first in that time alone.

143
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:15,158
So if you go up one step, you won't fall from there. I don't know about it now. I used to do it, nostalgic, what did I use? The very first thing, royal.

144
00:37:15,158 --> 00:37:30,133
With a sleeping bishop on the way. Vampire.

145
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:45,093
I wonder if I used Necro occasionally. You can tell that it's a bounce type.

146
00:37:45,093 --> 00:38:00,110
It's called a bounce that you want to take out the card and withdraw. It's a bounce character, 8 episodes. I wasn't very good at bounces, so I didn't do much.

147
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:15,103
Mitch was doing it occasionally. The best thing to do is to have a kettle and a royal and bishop. I also did vampires once in a while.

148
00:38:15,103 --> 00:38:30,156
There was a mountain of birds. Pyon Pyon Pyon Pyon It was said that it was done at that time.

149
00:38:30,156 --> 00:38:45,193
It's an interesting game, but I wanted to come back and change it because I had a unique sense. There was a dinos.

150
00:38:45,193 --> 00:39:00,172
I miss it, but I liked it. I still like it, but I haven't been there, so I don't know how far it will be.

151
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:15,144
You may like seminar card games quite a bit. Stop playing physical card games. I wonder if I can do it in that sense. I still say it because I like it.

152
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:30,145
It's like that. Thank you for your hard work, Mr. English. I bought a video CD for consecutive holidays. Thank you for your patience.

153
00:39:30,145 --> 00:39:45,138
Next. I'm sorry.

154
00:39:45,138 --> 00:40:00,150
Too late. I'm sorry for the time, wasn't it a mess?

155
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:15,134
What do you mean. Thank you for being like crushing the bokeh. Shiorashi White Durable.

156
00:40:15,134 --> 00:40:30,177
Kishisato already needs a moderator who speaks Oshiage. There are many Russians in Mito Natto, but not all of them are well-behaved. Dexter too.

157
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:45,159
Are you talking now? See you tomorrow. Separately. The same is true for Japanese people.

158
00:40:45,159 --> 00:41:00,122
Not everyone is in competition when it comes to blunting. Certainly it is.

159
00:41:00,122 --> 00:41:15,184
That's right. Well, I wonder what the language is. After all, the shape of the letters is different from the English on the price tag, so it may be a little step back. Japanese a little more.

160
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:30,151
I would like to have a comment section so that everyone can enjoy it. Thank you.

161
00:41:30,151 --> 00:41:45,159
Certainly that's a little bit, I think moderators may want to consider it. Mr. Chiebukuro I heard that RTA is over. It's less than 5/5 minutes.

162
00:41:45,159 --> 00:42:00,160
Is it okay to put a radish into an electric fan? I heard that an older sister who didn't know at a drug bar was talking about him. He said it was good that the tattoo of the whole sutra was written on his back.

163
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:15,111
It's terrible, isn't it? It's all in. The quantity surveyor is cute 8.

164
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:30,208
300 Police officer Even a dentist lost consciousness on the way, so I'm going to fall asleep. I'm serious about sleeping properly.

165
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:45,161
Thank you very much. Beast Forest I don't deliver it. I'd like to do it on Monday.

166
00:42:45,161 --> 00:43:00,193
Come on tomorrow, Mr. Sushiro. It might be good to make rules for erotic streams. Many beginners behave foolishly if they don't understand. I see, that's true.

167
00:43:00,193 --> 00:43:15,167
But I understand that Arles, which is only in English, is in Japanese. Let's do that a little. Let's talk. Why don't you talk like a store lady?

168
00:43:15,167 --> 00:43:30,137
You know. Let's write it.

169
00:43:30,137 --> 00:43:45,101
A thread that seems to be taken from the opposite side. That's no good, Nene-chan, I didn't do it, I just saw it.

170
00:43:45,101 --> 00:44:00,135
That house uses a crane to move the soul of the takoyaki. It seems that it's not like walking like moving it like this. I said official Ok. I wasted the previous delivery.

171
00:44:00,135 --> 00:44:15,095
It seems that he was just angry at me in vain. It's kind of okay, Nene-chan is doing it today.

172
00:44:15,095 --> 00:44:30,218
Because, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not the case, right? Today, the opposite takoyaki, plain, poke an egg.

173
00:44:30,218 --> 00:44:45,120
That's right, you see, I just got angry. It seems that I was just angry at the atmosphere. It's finally good at all.

174
00:44:45,120 --> 00:45:00,163
It's OK because it's interesting, but that's it. It's true until I hit my uncle on purpose. Because is it a bad guy? You guys Oramie.

175
00:45:00,163 --> 00:45:15,128
I'm done with everything. But it seems like I can come It's a comment, but if this is not possible, it's okay. Other places Just follow other rules. Anything that seems to be good.

176
00:45:15,128 --> 00:45:30,100
It's not an arrow stamp, so the official is okay. This usage is OK for Morley.

177
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:45,138
That's why it's not OK in other places, so just be careful there. Oh yeah yeah, please check there for a moment. Just 23.

178
00:45:45,138 --> 00:46:00,132
It seems to be good. Just be careful about that. Yes. It's a little funny now just because I got angry in an interesting atmosphere.

179
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:15,141
Really. At that time, I was really angry just because of the atmosphere. It's not bad.

180
00:46:15,141 --> 00:46:30,116
I don't know, but this is sometimes. We are in the atmosphere.

181
00:46:30,116 --> 00:46:45,144
My neighbor Ken Shimura I have some fabric because I couldn't work with him. I told him to do Chelsea and thought it was okay to participate in the King. Thank you for the guy behind this.

182
00:46:45,144 --> 00:47:00,269

185
00:47:30,093 --> 00:47:45,154
Grow. I think it feels like you can be. On the side of raising. I felt like I was wondering whether to take the exam.

186
00:47:45,154 --> 00:48:00,111
You said you were aiming for tomorrow's Shizuoka. I passed the exam, so I am an acupuncturist. There is.

187
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:15,117
That's amazing, thank you. I'm sorry for the delivery at such a time.

188
00:48:15,117 --> 00:48:30,154
Documents Kissho Please be sure to take it. I'm waiting. No, it's amazing.

189
00:48:30,154 --> 00:48:45,086
I'm sorry, so I was just about to pass. It was from there.

190
00:48:45,086 --> 00:49:00,239
If you look at the people who are doing their best, you will not be able to do your best either. You can say that we can say that we should do our best together like this. Let's do our best together.

191
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:15,094
Well then, let's read next.

192

194
00:49:45,089 --> 00:50:00,180
The day when Spa-chan from the second term of Spetsnaz will come soon may be near. There may be. You might stop by Spetsnaz. The weather forecast that everyone wanted to come in.

195
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:15,107
Because the world is wide. I'm already here. Orca.

196
00:50:15,107 --> 00:50:30,119
I don't know ORCA. I have to do my best.

197
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:45,115
But I don't know, I don't know because I can't read that much yet. Well, if you react stupidly, it's out. surely. More.

198
00:50:45,115 --> 00:51:00,099
I don't know what it is. It's different, but if it's more Spetsnaz, maybe I can say that it's a source of play. I think I can probably go.

199
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:15,108
Photona interior. I wonder if there is a possibility that it will come out.

200
00:51:15,108 --> 00:51:30,168
You may be a former SAS insurance investigator. It might be a former Navy SEALs guy. It will spread.

201
00:51:30,168 --> 00:51:45,189
Maybe because there are. I may enter. Since I became Samantha Thavasa SSR B, I've made friends with various SSR B people. I think it's thanks to everyone, but I'm sorry.

202

Tell us the secrets of Nexus 3 A Spetsnaz soldier is looking at you with it, but most of it is an archive. Big bamboo string figure smell.

203
00:52:00,163 --> 00:52:15,160
Exa 3 I'm from Russia, so maybe I'm watching a movie with my friend. I see it, but it's almost an archive.

204
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:30,147
There was one. The food stalls are really tight.

205
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:45,160
That's true of the rear tie. It's hard to clear the Taie even if it's normal. Maeda is delivered almost every day only at Hololive Production, and I'm almost every day.

206
00:52:45,160 --> 00:53:00,133
I'm going to deliver it at the set. Thank you for showing us one milk.

207

If you ask, there is no privacy issue. I'm here.

208
00:53:15,107 --> 00:53:30,114
I think it's good to say that many people know about hololive. I'm happy. I'm sorry, it's a little chat, but I've become a woman, but the delivery is a little around here. Thank you weather forecast.

209
00:53:30,114 --> 00:53:45,175

211
00:54:00,129 --> 00:54:15,247
Thank you for the delivery today, but I did it day and night, but please sleep slowly today I think it's Kai Ken's bell, Maasa, so please do your best. See you all again. Paka Paka.
