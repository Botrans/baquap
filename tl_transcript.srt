1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,647
This way of folding is really cool.

2
00:00:19,647 --> 00:00:49,592
Oh I see. Um ...

3
00:00:49,592 --> 00:01:04,687
It's not in the middle of the moment when it becomes. After shaking to the side.

4
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:19,672
The opposite is the moment you press the arrow keys. The moment you put it in right. It's a great deal.

5
00:01:19,672 --> 00:01:34,688
It looks like the right. It is widely said that Nobita and the opposite direction key input. You can limit that speed.

6
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:49,692
Please remember. How many dolls are you putting in now?

7
00:01:49,692 --> 00:02:04,649
Will it be rough?

8
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:19,615
By staying. There will be a grace period.

9
00:02:19,615 --> 00:02:34,621
Abune.

10
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:49,651
Tomato What is this?

11
00:02:49,651 --> 00:03:19,619
It feels like Yoshiko-sensei. 1/3 This is like Mr. Hoshiko.

12
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:34,577
Wow.

13
00:03:34,577 --> 00:03:49,710
Abeno Characon is alive It seems that it is such an interesting game for free. You can play such a game Rice. I'm sorry I can still go, but the game is amazing even though I'm young and I don't get drunk at all.

14
00:03:49,710 --> 00:04:04,667
I can't go 100,000 in this game. should not. do.

15
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:19,667
It's over, so I opened the window.

16
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:34,693
It's free and please be honest.

17
00:04:34,693 --> 00:04:49,639
I saw the comment section. When you cut 100, it's over.

18
00:04:49,639 --> 00:05:04,613
What a nice game. I wonder if I can get 7 sheets. I wonder if I can go.

19
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:19,647
70070 series Let's go. I can't finish making 2 goals.

20
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:34,617
I'll die.

21
00:05:34,617 --> 00:06:04,655
If you go at the same interval as before.

22
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:19,661
I don't know how many points are growing. If you crush the tomatoes, the score may increase. I wonder if it's better to crush Matt.

23
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:34,657
Stand up to the end. Me, pizza, or everyone in the Familiaran?

24
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:49,671
This was 16000 yen.

25
00:06:49,671 --> 00:07:04,666
Tomato. I think it's 1000 points. It doesn't look like it.

26
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:19,681
How many meters are piled up in one second? This is Hatsumi-san.

27
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:34,661
Now this is probably 10,000 voices.

28
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:49,653
I don't know how many tomatoes I have. Please tell me who the conductor knows the capture site. I can wait for this.

29
00:07:49,653 --> 00:08:04,666
It's 1093 points.

30
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:19,675
I wonder if it's in the tomato score. I think the spring song where the pizza cheese wall appears is probably the same.

31
00:08:19,675 --> 00:08:34,680
It also contains cheese, but this is probably a tomato can test.

32
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:49,709
If the distance from the pizza to the second pizza is 400 M, there is only 400 Distance. Tomatoes.

33
00:08:49,709 --> 00:09:04,665
Only the teacher recognizes it. Maybe it's okay to be depressed when it rains.

34
00:09:04,665 --> 00:09:19,674
Even though I say I'm doing my best.

35
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:34,654
I'm diving in the pizza so hard.

36
00:09:34,654 --> 00:09:49,629
This is two. 70,000 endurance may be dangerous.

37
00:09:49,629 --> 00:10:19,673
But now I'm wearing two.

38
00:10:19,673 --> 00:10:34,659
It's three times as long as it is now.

39
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:49,681
The speed increases as you go to the second half. Maybe it's already increasing. Because it is a distance, it is the same as how many meters you have traveled. I'll put out the game I made in another week.

40
00:10:49,681 --> 00:11:04,676
That's not the case, so that's an exponential function. What is the acceleration of points?

41
00:11:04,676 --> 00:11:19,662
If the speed increases. If you endure a little more. Don't break the tomatoes.

42
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:34,645
Keep away from the wall. That of the putter.

43
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:49,675
Using toppings. Somewhat high. Please give me the time to decide whether to send it. I feel like I can make it.

44
00:11:49,675 --> 00:12:19,701
I think I can play a lot of games with people who don't get drunk.

45
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:34,685
It feels like I have a headache when it comes little by little. There is absolutely.

46
00:12:34,685 --> 00:13:04,659
I'll do my best and try jumping. Avoid two-dimensional jumps.

47
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:19,683
When that happens, everyone is in this game.

48
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:34,669
You can play smartphone games on your right hand.

49
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:49,655
Jump Chi.

50
00:13:49,655 --> 00:14:04,659
I feel like I'm riding a tomato now. Hamajima side.

51
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:19,668
E-tele. Mr. For example, go to the ceiling.

52
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:34,671
If you have a lot of monitors later, you'll have that.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:14:49,082
Not a stock. You can do this or something like that.
