5
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:15,101

6
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:30,134
It's a mark, but it's a comment. There is that normally.

7
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:45,125
I can't say it, but I'm no longer tied to Apex. It is finally possible for the company to do it.

8
00:03:45,125 --> 00:04:00,106
Go up to 2. Thank you very much. I'm sorry for that family.

9
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:15,177
For all members. Tell me a little in the text. Immediately after being in the strongest deciding match. What do you call that?

10
00:04:15,177 --> 00:04:30,210
I think I'll forget it, so I'll tell you about it so I'll leave it a little more, so I'll write it in the A-side article.

11
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:45,143
Everyone is crying. I'm still there. Lobotomy Corporation It's expensive to stop reminding me, but Kururinpa.

12
00:04:45,143 --> 00:05:00,169
Hey, uncle I'm not crying I wonder why everyone is crying but it's still like everything It was a wonderful tournament Thank you.

13
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:15,136
The seeds got worse when I wrote that it was my first look. Maybe one blur has been crushed now, everyone. Poop 3 days 3 days.

14
00:05:15,136 --> 00:05:30,113
Crying and crying. The more I cry. It was no good.

15
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:45,124
It was good, but it doesn't come out, shuffle. What was entwined with my shoulders? Is it the first time?

16
00:05:45,124 --> 00:06:00,113
Maybe. Thank you for the salmon butter saute.

17
00:06:00,113 --> 00:06:15,147
Lie lie lie lie lie. that.

18
00:06:15,147 --> 00:06:30,075
Because it's a devil. It was a memorable off.

19
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:45,163
It's in 23 D just because I don't know. Not in.

20
00:06:45,163 --> 00:07:00,126
There is a femur. Yusa put up some illustrations.

21
00:07:00,126 --> 00:07:15,131
Itado: Maybe it's because I saw the name. And what did you apologize for with the egg?

22
00:07:15,131 --> 00:07:30,117
I was crying tattered.

23
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:45,155
So please let me remember and lend me a thank you. It doesn't come out. That's a short song.

24
00:07:45,155 --> 00:08:00,118
Mr. Ibrahim talked, really.

25
00:08:00,118 --> 00:08:15,120
What was wrong with the chat? A yes yes yes yes yes yes. Is it chocolate or me? I'm alone until shuffle.

26
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:30,105
I was surprised at that.

27
00:08:30,105 --> 00:08:45,092
Bruise. What is Largo Haru-san?

28
00:08:45,092 --> 00:09:00,075
I didn't really understand. Well, wait a minute.

29
00:09:00,075 --> 00:09:15,193
That Ibrahim-san is written by Abrahim-san, and Ibrahim-san is the only one Ibrahim-san. That's why I correct people's names.

30
00:09:15,193 --> 00:09:30,082
Tell me you made a mistake. I was pinning. I was talking insanely.

31
00:09:30,082 --> 00:09:45,112
earrings. Ear earrings. Sea lion.

32
00:09:45,112 --> 00:10:00,133
I don't know if it's pizza, but that's it. I wish there was such a story. It's interesting.

33
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:15,158
My name. I don't know what to do from there somewhere in the future.

34
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:30,179
I hope you remember it. Even though I didn't go, it's true, but with Mr. Yamato, it seems that he was taken care of at a later tournament somewhere.

35
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:45,144
Finally, I thought it was good to have something like that. Oh yeah yeah yeah I was doing Avex a while ago.

36
00:10:45,144 --> 00:11:00,134
I was wondering what to do with dinner from the side when a strange child ate soba.

37
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:15,179
I don't want to cook this today, so I thought I'd cook it for tomorrow's dinner. I'm grilling chicken, but it doesn't matter if it's not dinner, but uh.

38
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:30,123
I fell asleep after eating. that.

39
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:45,163
Is it the highest if it is 2? With Platinum 2. Bert. Mobile purchase Only once When you dive in Rankma.

40
00:11:45,163 --> 00:12:00,149
Fight platinum. Was it 5500? I don't remember that the gacha was 3 years old, so 6000.

41
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:15,167
From there, it's an hour and a half from 19:00 to 20:30. I was really happy with my allies. Something.

42
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:30,150
It's not like page 090, but 1500 damage, 2 kills, 4 assists.

43
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:45,129
4 kills 2 assists. Best Champion 1st East. I'm gonna wear it at the same time and die.

44
00:12:45,129 --> 00:13:00,129
Great paraphrase. Nanda Kanda One month APEC That hunt.

45
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:15,142
I realized that I was doing it alone. It was early in the morning. I was the first to be the fastest.

46
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:30,046
thank you.

47
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:45,139
I've come seriously, so if I've grown up, really. From the land I'm after all.

48
00:13:45,139 --> 00:14:00,100
Yumi Kumazaki I too. Monster Strike Noah Cell I really hit you.

49
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:15,152
It will be difficult. I'm used to it now. But ...

50
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:30,151
It's exactly the same as when the yearly delivery was full of choregi a while ago.

51
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:45,106
If you do it, 10 of the hammer.

52
00:14:45,106 --> 00:15:00,121
How far has it been? Really. Let's study by ourselves.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,111
I wonder. I really saw that level for a month. Enjoying Mito A really good experience.

54
00:00:15,111 --> 00:00:30,112
Thank you so much for being so tired of crying in front of your favorite computer.

55
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:45,134
Red I think I'll do it from time to time, and I'll do it. Season 8 dunk. But at the level of getting paid, Kurama said he would die.

56
00:00:45,134 --> 00:01:00,143
I'm sorry I forgot about Namba and I'm sorry to say something terrible. I'm worried about fraud.

57
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:15,161
Even if I'm a bird, I'll take notes. I'll do my best because I'll be serious about it. It's still in my notebook, really. Mika is the best.

58
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:30,142
That's right from Otaru I ate rice I woke up at noon and ate soba so it's all color today.

59
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:45,136
Muffler Baffle Fish is Hula Thank you Welcome to Welcome me. After all, I was doing Avex for a month. thought.

60
00:01:45,136 --> 00:02:00,146
Like a teacher. Yes, do you feel like quitting?

61
00:02:00,146 --> 00:02:15,133
This guy is awesome. What are you fighting for? Mega. When I got a little stronger. I'm saying it's different, but it's not.

62
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:30,116
You have to do it only once in these two houses.

63
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:45,156
Don't secure a way to escape by hitting the enemy sold by your allies. Somehow. It's still platinum, so it's still a long way off.

64
00:02:45,156 --> 00:03:00,160
Still, it was good that this was a little different.

65
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:15,144
I couldn't do something that was painful, so I was answering that kind of thing, right? Abiko Thank you.

66
00:03:15,144 --> 00:03:30,133
I have to decide even this week. Miyabi-kun.

67
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:45,169
I'd be happy if I could get out. The house will be in the new season next week.

68
00:03:45,169 --> 00:04:00,121
I'm really looking forward to it because the number of fuses will increase. It seems difficult. Seriously for now. Nandakanda.

69
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:15,131
Dead by Daylight I want to keep it, but what should I do? Miyabi This road I can't say what it is.

70
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:30,111
After all, I was in 5th place last time. What is a Honda Horizon event?

71
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:45,126
From the strongest. Are you willing to use the future? PicsArt.

72
00:04:45,126 --> 00:05:00,136
I was in 5th place. Aorinpa Reka Yes Yes Spring Female from a child.

73
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:15,125
Yes Yes Yes I haven't done that. The message from the child seems to go.

74
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:30,124
Even if you can't do it at the competition because it's the strongest in the school. It's not a frog inside. I see.

75
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:45,122
The whole family is celebrating. Origami and charm Flowers in a rare pair.

76
00:05:45,122 --> 00:06:00,118
Because it intersects, I wonder if it doesn't get in the way of people.

77
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:15,120
Is it because you are named Raccoon Drose? The one who looks closely is that raccoon, so yes.

78
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:30,136
Nobu Oda's growth. Takaoka City Tateno 2020. Look at it.

79
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:45,093
It was written by a person named Raccoon Nekotaro. Talk to me today. The last man sleeps with crying.

80
00:06:45,093 --> 00:07:00,159
It was youth. I'm surprised because it comes in English.

81
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:15,101
It's been a while since youth. Club activities, I'm here. It seems like it gets so hot, so it's pretty good.

82
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:30,173
I've never been to high school or college. It seems that I entered it because there was a cross.

83
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:45,169
I was doing it. I'll study for the exam anyway, so a little. It was a sport compact.

84
00:07:45,169 --> 00:08:00,142
Club activities For people who have fun or remember club activities.

85
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:15,149
Who knows that kind of thing, I understand Go Shogi club, etc. For the time being, it seems that a celebration will come when I have to join club activities.

86
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:30,150
It's 37. But it's 37.

87
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:45,158
Everyone. I don't have a diss I don't have a diss at all. I also want to watch a movie.

88
00:08:45,158 --> 00:09:00,170
Well, maybe because how many people are coming.

89
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:15,170
At that time, I went to work in the morning or during the day and only at night. Something. After all, I couldn't do it if I continued with this series of choices.

90
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:30,222
It's a stepping stone to do it with just one god. It's still 3 months.

91
00:09:30,222 --> 00:09:45,163
I had a month and I had a pie. It wouldn't have been possible if it was late, though I didn't enter.

92
00:09:45,163 --> 00:10:00,134
After that it was good. I thought it was on that bench.

93
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:15,134
I was able to see the monster for the first time from Scream. The tournament has not arrived. Matsukaze A word like that. An uncle named Bell from Berg will come in from his older brother, so please take a look at that too.

94
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:30,149
Poi's mother Now, like a demon king or a baby-like mafia. Like.

95
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:45,140
There are various things like robots that are good at singing, so it's a little bit like that.

96
00:10:45,140 --> 00:11:00,173
Ikageso Thank you for your hard work. To be honest, don't scold me even if I can't go drinking with a woman. My favorite dentist is wearing it. It will be the last time. Effector 3D People who get sick can never see it, so it moves quickly.

97
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:15,150
If some people did it, do it like this. Looking back. Will my dad change? Being kidnapped by Neko Akama. Hey tavern.

98
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:30,159
Daddy. I'm no longer a person.

99
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:45,101
Epiphone is amazing. That channel. It was a disaster prevention chair, isn't it? I wanted to enter only in Santa's Kochi, but together.

100
00:11:45,101 --> 00:12:00,091
The company is really a professional team called that rig.

101
00:12:00,091 --> 00:12:15,145
I heard that he was a coach. You're gonna do it, you're like you haven't picked up a ball for a year.

102
00:12:15,145 --> 00:12:30,105
It's still completely different from that type. Already laugh, use, talk suggestion.

103
00:12:30,105 --> 00:12:45,183
Don't miss me. It was East, really, at that house. He is also a tournament this weekend.

104
00:12:45,183 --> 00:13:00,130
Kochi Nice, yesterday tomorrow, you, I, and your coach endured 100 km.

105
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:15,115
While simply entering. I had a crush on the practice area. After all I will do it. Really a member of the anime rug.

106
00:13:15,115 --> 00:13:30,146
did not exist. He said he was drawing a line in Kochi. When he first introduced himself, it was already. I was saying that.

107
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:45,143
Someone who has such game-like knowledge like S is yours. I wonder if it's really the foundation of the foundation. I was told to explain on screen 9.

108
00:13:45,143 --> 00:14:15,115
At that time I was spicy. I want to give it, but at all. I wondered what kind of level it was. I've never been there.

109
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:30,161
There's Fortnite, right? I wonder what to do.

110
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:45,181
It's not at all. It looks like it's broken and peeking. I didn't launch it right now. Why did you shield it?

111
00:14:45,181 --> 00:15:00,145
You just have to hit it, it's like living. It's like let's scan the credit card. please tell me.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,115
Penis. How many shots did you hit?

113
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:30,129
It's not a strange Kogashiyama when you shoot 16 amazing shots. Bubbling up after being shaken by an ant.

114
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:45,137
After selling, I took him. Where to catch tomorrow 16 shots that you can hit if you come to a little place with lunch.

115
00:00:45,137 --> 00:01:00,114
I see. Enma-kun isn't here.

116
00:01:00,114 --> 00:01:15,147
It's coming to gymnastics.

117
00:01:15,147 --> 00:01:30,133
I tried. I was asking if you were doing this or that.

118
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:45,157
Bypass I fought against people of that level, so please do this.

119
00:01:45,157 --> 00:02:00,132
Something. You can make a picture right away. Of the brush.

120
00:02:00,132 --> 00:02:15,185
I wondered if it was that kind of power. What I want to convey now that I understand this. Tomorrow, Teru-kun will tell me that the square is huge. I'm sorry for the shooting training. I'm just talking about X.

121
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:30,094
There is a diamond-shaped, slightly larger window in the middle. Put them all in. I was told from 3 days before the tournament.

122
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:45,183
I can do it the day before the tournament. It's not perfect It's not perfect, but I told you to get together if you upload it.

123
00:02:45,183 --> 00:03:00,124
Anju eyes Barbers have become a group. I managed to do it.

124
00:03:00,124 --> 00:03:15,134
After seeing it, I'm the owner of that Kochi. After seeing it, I'm doing my best. I think the dimensions are different, isn't it?

125
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:30,111
Why with me on the day of the tournament. 23 hits at a short distance.

126
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:45,100
Daddy I think it's a shooting training ground. Pastel will also give you nails. Please tell me.

127
00:03:45,100 --> 00:04:00,168
amazing. Something like that, you throw it away. I went to 109 yesterday so maybe I'm sleeping.

128
00:04:00,168 --> 00:04:15,180
It may not be there, but that. At that time, that one game of Apex shouldn't be remembered.

129
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:30,145
If you poop, I have a champion, and that's what it is now. I have to. I think I can remember it.

130
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:45,145
Saying something like the game will be a memory. I was that close when I went to the ranks today.

131
00:04:45,145 --> 00:05:00,143
I was just crouching and eating. It looks like he was flying the drone.

132
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:15,159
Did you go to the ranks by yourself today? I thought that if I said Olympus, I would probably remember more things. untill forever.

133
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:30,093
That road will be empty too.

134
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:45,142
Saying that I had some fun. There were customers who could not be taken. Ice cream or something like ice cream photos can be cut here.

135
00:05:45,142 --> 00:06:00,069
Rice. Even if I wake up in the morning. Ah, really with your hard work.

136
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:15,076
that. I forgot to talk about it.

137
00:06:15,076 --> 00:06:30,131
And the fall is also won, and the alert to the first-timer is the place where the match match was also fought.

138
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:45,168
It's been so since it became a landmark of rugs. There was one more comment on the temperature of these things now. Doctor yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but wake up in the morning.

139
00:06:45,168 --> 00:07:00,122
Really something. It's over.

140
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:15,159
It 's amazing that you broke it. Daddy can meet 6/2. SEP 1.5 MP 9 for your hard work To Love.

141
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:30,140
Brim wpcr 93. See you the strongest. One break.

142
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:45,145
Comments from a former high school baseball player Like a high school baseball player. Throw 1000 times or Kita High School Koshien is over. Get up early.

143
00:07:45,145 --> 00:08:00,129
Then I suddenly noticed that I don't have to cut two more. Be surprised.

144
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:15,197
I entered the shooting training ground before going to that Rankma today. I grabbed it. I did recoil properly until the ball healed in the diamond, and then I went to Rakuma.

145
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:30,103
That's why it's okay.

146
00:08:30,103 --> 00:08:45,139
That's right, I have to adjust it. It's on. I'm watching if it's okay.

147
00:08:45,139 --> 00:09:00,121
Yoshimi and Hey. change.

148
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:15,130
It seems that I was thinking for a moment, but it will change. I'm still wondering if I'm touching it, though. After all I'm a little.

149
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:30,107
I heard there was a change. It was a fun and enjoyable month.

150
00:09:30,107 --> 00:09:45,147
Why did you get punished for that nature? I didn't. Also, while reading that message, I said it was awesome, this week a little next week.

151
00:09:45,147 --> 00:10:00,124
I'm really busy next week, but it's over, so it's kind of like this game that Holmen said, you should do it too. The hall has to be, uncle.

152
00:10:00,124 --> 00:10:15,184
If the dragon appears only on Saturdays and Sundays, it will be a little Saturday and Sunday. Shitara-san's game plaza is here. Hey, that sea got angry, so the details are so small.

153
00:10:15,184 --> 00:10:30,135
Villa. There are a lot of fried foods, and I'm sure they were shining. 4 is enough, so seriously.

154
00:10:30,135 --> 00:10:45,145
I have to throw it on the floor. Stupid stupid. On the spot.

155
00:10:45,145 --> 00:11:00,125
I'm probably right now. That's stupid, that's mom too.

156
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:15,142
Even though I didn't hit that, the secretariat came to this one team in the match. Somehow it's enough. I didn't know. Really.

157
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:30,102
I'm not there anymore, really.

158
00:11:30,102 --> 00:11:45,094
I don't have it anymore.

159
00:11:45,094 --> 00:12:00,095
I'm using that now. When I scanned it, it was 12.12 when 1 was a double part.

160
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:15,103
There is a trap when cleaning or when scanning. I think about it, but when I said Kyosuke-san, there were only three, so I processed it.

161
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:30,151
But I can't even meet beginners. There are medical devices and medical devices.

162
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:45,106
8 words that let you grenade with 8 syringes. Look already. But from the end, really.

163
00:12:45,106 --> 00:13:00,106
Suspicious person, etc. Judgment is slow.

164
00:13:00,106 --> 00:13:15,085
Really greedy. The current eagle is like that.

165
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:30,103
Really. Somehow, there are two stamps.

166
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:45,116
Scale-san It's not really sly. Only noodles are 1000 for Mr. Scale Taki. Rare already.

167
00:13:45,116 --> 00:14:00,101
Slap's judgment is quick now. Even if you shave. It may be cold again a year later.

168
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:15,106
I'm saying it with my fist. I've been told apic.

169
00:14:15,106 --> 00:14:30,114
You will be satisfied. There is no motion to slap.

170
00:14:30,114 --> 00:14:45,172
I want to go to diamonds, but after all. It's already. Okay maybe. National Super Mario-kun.

171
00:14:45,172 --> 00:15:00,164
Maybe if you can bring a knife because you are late in making a decision. Because it's easy.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,107
I got a lot of budgets.

173
00:00:15,107 --> 00:00:30,141
I think somewhere. Anyway, what does it cost to derail? After that, I said I'm not used to it and it will be over in 2 hours, so I'll leave.

174
00:00:30,141 --> 00:00:45,110
Talk moderately. please. Before that ball started.

175
00:00:45,110 --> 00:01:00,101
The bag is the strongest three-Munsell. Show it to all the big players.

176
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:15,113
You can see polka, right? It really remains in another place after that, on the delivery screen. To myself.

177
00:01:15,113 --> 00:01:30,140
I received it today. The successful applicants are amazing. To be before, to change jobs That's right.

178
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:45,146
It seems that you can speak Japanese, so it is advantageous to change jobs. After the dad is gone, not the master and the child burger How to call it Egg 3 Um, this.

179
00:01:45,146 --> 00:02:00,123
There are many overseas viewers, including the older sisters of Hololive Production.

180
00:02:00,123 --> 00:02:15,182
The reason I speak English is that the students say that the cat is Congrats in the comments because of that. I don't understand Japanese, but he came to see me. I'm wondering if it's the king who is awake.

181
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:30,098
I'm really sorry to bother you every time. Congratulations on passing all uncle. Because it is popular overseas.

182
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:45,192
Overseas listeners. If you're called a dad, you're not only calling him a bot, but also a dad.

183
00:02:45,192 --> 00:03:00,118
Spring edible wild plants.

184
00:03:00,118 --> 00:03:15,130
If the social kappa level is too high, it will cool down if you bring it. 60% of listeners are popular overseas. That's it.

185
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:30,137
Yes PaPa and this is my dad and sister daddy daddy. Is that pizza pasta?

186
00:03:30,137 --> 00:03:45,136
Pizza daddy is multi and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Go with follow members.

187
00:03:45,136 --> 00:04:00,168
Daddy, put on your heart, it's kind of dangerous, though. Maybe.

188
00:04:00,168 --> 00:04:15,119
Maybe I don't know. And my dad is cracked. So.

189
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:30,127
The people who gathered there talked about me. The overseas form.

190
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:45,144
Alan Aru-san.

191
00:04:45,144 --> 00:05:00,112
Not me. Like an uncle. I don't know how to do yoga, so it's fine.

192
00:05:00,112 --> 00:05:15,113
There is a member of the father's association today.

193
00:05:15,113 --> 00:05:30,135
But Alain-san, Aru-san, and Dad. You talk when you're not there.

194
00:05:30,135 --> 00:05:45,088
I sometimes go out. A ** Please call me as you like.

195
00:05:45,088 --> 00:06:00,131
It says a certain egg. Well, that dad was decided like this. I'm afraid.

196
00:06:00,131 --> 00:06:15,144
What do you want me to call you together? Call me Aki-chan, grandma. Die unhappy.

197
00:06:15,144 --> 00:06:45,110
How to praise A-chan. I haven't received that rain, but I feel sorry for Shohei Tanaka, who is from the second middle school.

198
00:06:45,110 --> 00:07:00,043
It's difficult.

199
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:15,125
You see, this is right here. It's not a cursed doll.

200
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:30,143
Kana in the center Achan Daddy I'm tired. I wonder why this helps.

201
00:07:30,143 --> 00:07:45,160
Ah-chan Lion Dance So this isn't just A-chan's impersonation, A-chan. Instead of me. I have to get rid of it, but I'm a little tired.

202
00:07:45,160 --> 00:08:00,094
I'm wearing it.

203
00:08:00,094 --> 00:08:15,157
It's 5,000 yen in January, so if it's 4,000 yen, it's not 200 yen. I don't know that's close.

204
00:08:15,157 --> 00:08:30,149
Ah-chan always had a lion dance that was only a lion dance A-chan. That's what it seems to be limited.

205
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:45,129
Idols Underground idol kerosene isn't about 5,000 yen to take with me. I heard that it will be about that. It's 5,000 yen now, but that's the correct answer.

206
00:08:45,129 --> 00:09:00,120
I made a mistake Thank you Thank you What? It's about 500 yen. Somehow it's about 1005.

207
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:15,132
Something. A long time ago. Watch the current news program.

208
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:30,143
What do you say? It's like the back of a profession that everyone doesn't know. The idol.

209
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:45,104
It's the main source of income for that live performance. Some people just work on lathes. It looks like you can make so much money.

210
00:09:45,104 --> 00:10:00,143
There are also bok choy and cinema live, but I want to buy goods as the main.

211
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:15,173
But my uncle thought it was a good business while drinking that coffee. It was 1000 yen, but maybe this is my image.

212
00:10:15,173 --> 00:10:30,122
Place the bill between Sadako's little finger and ring finger.

213
00:10:30,122 --> 00:10:45,196
South Central. If it doesn't work, it's mosaiced with cacao and which group cut isn't revealed.

214
00:10:45,196 --> 00:11:00,132
Goto: That's what happens when you succeed. 430,000 mm.

215
00:11:00,132 --> 00:11:15,144
If it was about 100,000 yen. February.

216
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:30,109
That was a little surprised. I'm not doing it. I'm wiping my butt.

217
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:45,121
There are too many. It's not like eating rice for 10,000 yen. The uncle who is eating is already.

218
00:11:45,121 --> 00:12:00,106
I can't say that I'm still really talking about people. benzene.

219
00:12:00,106 --> 00:12:15,128
That's right, maybe the box over there. You see, it's bright, but I don't know why scales are good.

220
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:30,087
Where is the information?

221
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:45,145
Something. that. My grandfather. Don't do it in Abe with your own money.

222
00:12:45,145 --> 00:13:00,109
Oh yeah yeah there is such a culture. What is it?

223
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:15,087
I lost to poop. It was artificially released. Did you talk about this?

224
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:30,148
In Italy. I worked in punk. Working at a big bank. There are nails.

225
00:13:30,148 --> 00:13:45,120
When pinched. I'm good at it. It's amazing.

226
00:13:45,120 --> 00:14:00,131
Gundam That's that bank. I picked it up too much.

227
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:15,157
I understand. I don't know if it was squid. My grandfather has a special skill.

228
00:14:15,157 --> 00:14:30,164
Because it's already a year. Maybe because it was a star. Final Cut Thank you.

229
00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:45,115
Cashier bite 10-yen coin Kana That kind of special skill. Only small change is amazing. I suddenly remembered it in my profession.

230
00:14:45,115 --> 00:15:00,136
Yes, the person who licks at 6 o'clock now. That?

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,094
Drink more and more and lick it from what age.

232
00:00:15,094 --> 00:00:30,115
It's hard to get back with the bandages off. Maybe it's because it's dry, isn't it?

233
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:45,116
There was a person who licked it. It's almost over 40 Luna Luna.

234
00:00:45,116 --> 00:01:00,119
That's it 7 Thank you Adele. Plastic bag. I knew it was early and came home.

235
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:15,115
It's okay to lick stamps. I'm sure it's more common than licking when wearing that hair accessory.

236
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:30,135
It's not. You can come to lick it. It's not over open.

237
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:45,124
Ah, I see I see. That's true.

238
00:01:45,124 --> 00:02:00,151
Yo. As the body fluid of the quickest child in the world.

239
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:15,120
Look at this time. If you don't like it, do it.

240
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:30,136
But. I haven't done it.

241
00:02:30,136 --> 00:02:45,092
It may be your tears.

242
00:02:45,092 --> 00:03:00,113
I from. But laugh. I cried.

243
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:15,129
I cleaned the ball, but I don't know where the story came from, so I can't cut it without a rice ball.

244
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:30,163
As might be expected. Yeah, do your best. Something I don't understand is cheerful.

245
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:45,103
It doesn't come out until 7 hours. Before the delivery of Mano Dam or before the start. I will come out.

246
00:03:45,103 --> 00:04:00,118
Please. It says glhf Thank you. Ice Hair Daddy Thank you.

247
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:15,109
Did you say that you didn't remember when you saw it in the first half of the wilderness action?

248
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:30,117
Is there. Hello. Look at the composer of ah. It's a plug-in. That's it.

249
00:04:30,117 --> 00:04:45,131
What is it?

250
00:04:45,131 --> 00:05:00,110
It's like a legendary sword. There is that.

251
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:15,160
You've got it. You really did your best, and it was amazing. He sent out a lot of things. I wonder if he encouraged me by doing a cat at the end of the first round of the ANA trip.

252
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:30,116
Who is it? Because I was serious.

253
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:45,190
Yes, the new rice is heading. IQ AKB It seems that it is completely different whether there are highlights from the perspective of various people.

254
00:05:45,190 --> 00:06:00,127
It was a hot match. Thank you for your hard work. Around here. Nice fight.

255
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:15,102
I'm tired hard until now. Thank you for showing me the best one. No, the final match really.

256
00:06:15,102 --> 00:06:30,114
It was a hot match. Thank you for crying.

257
00:06:30,114 --> 00:06:45,111
Thank you very much. It's a battle. That was nervous.

258
00:06:45,111 --> 00:07:00,131
About 1000 didn't work at all. It's 5,000 eyes without permission.

259
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:15,120
What do you say? I didn't get it. Yeah it was good.

260
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:30,143
No matter how many times I practice for a month, no one else. Charging crunchy champion Someone who took it.

261
00:07:30,143 --> 00:07:45,120
What is Champion today in practice? It's not a tournament monster, though. After all it is in the air.

262
00:07:45,120 --> 00:08:00,165
I was so happy to tell you that during the production.

263
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:15,138
Adults were in 14th place until the end. Go first. It was really good.

264
00:08:15,138 --> 00:08:30,132
Hey Aigo, everyone believes in each other.

265
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:45,146
No, I was able to fight. Yes Thank you Yes.

266
00:08:45,146 --> 00:09:00,110
The carp is funny. That's not it. I was aiming for.

267
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:15,195
It means that those three people were able to complete it. I want a computer here, but yes. Eat delivery.

268
00:09:15,195 --> 00:09:30,146
I'm glad I got Red Bull, too. I want my computer to come by some mistake. I wonder if this was the case.

269
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:45,163
I'm licking Roberto's shoes, so I'm glad you're Country Ma'am.

270
00:09:45,163 --> 00:10:00,157
Because that computer has a better graphics card than me. I'm not saying that.

271
00:10:00,157 --> 00:10:15,146
I will not do it. There are so many 70s on board, so what is that kind of thing?

272
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:30,161
There was. Mika Ichinose I think I'm about to cry Why are you about to cry?

273
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:45,130
Something is that, the red spa is thrown silently at the current Super Chat. The shape of the throw is a little open and the name is not good, isn't it? That's money.

274
00:10:45,130 --> 00:11:00,138
This is a little emo. Really this. I wonder if there is something that isn't there. This is Saga's kanji.

275
00:11:00,138 --> 00:11:15,119
I'm a lot of friends. Rugby Setagaya.

276
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:30,058
Hooray.

277
00:11:30,058 --> 00:11:45,165
If it looked like red. If you're a member of Manna, you'll understand it because you read it, but it's just a part of that woman.

278
00:11:45,165 --> 00:12:00,134
It's really true to quote a part only on the net. Thread the thread Thread the thread through the hole in the needle. It's a cultural choice.

279
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:15,106
Something in particular, I'm ringing hundreds of times more than I am. That's Aigo.

280
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:30,137

But if you let me. I've only watched the last game, but I wonder.

283
00:13:00,135 --> 00:13:15,120
CR Kappa is too high level. I want to wake up Lan Pastel-kun while encouraging the shape.

284
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:30,125
That is. I want to look back. It was the same. There are a lot of people dancing, really.

285
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:45,136
I wouldn't have seen it no matter who was missing. Omi 23, I think there was a drama that was made.

That's really true. Mt. Akiha.

294
00:00:45,119 --> 00:01:00,151
It would be great if the autumn rules were revised.

295
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:15,133
I don't know when it will be. I thought I should go to the bathroom in Chiba. Bedwetting isn't a little wide.

301
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:45,134
Izuru-kun's party pastel-kun. If it was this rule, those two would have been level if they were Predators.

302
00:02:45,134 --> 00:03:00,156
I want to avoid those two going to the diamond. Platinum 2 Platinum 4 Kumeda was the highest rank.

303
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:15,107
I hated it, it was just a putter This is Daiei. Is it useless if I exceed the points? I will transfer to Tenkosha.

359
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:15,155
That's why, did you kill everyone's collaboration? It's a cafe.

360
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:30,141
Where did it change?

361
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:45,146

00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:45,140
Oh no, I'm a follower.

370
00:04:45,140 --> 00:05:00,148

So here in front of the house, towards the microphone. Please come out.

That's right. There is also a history of that kind of thing.

373
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:45,137
If I was aiming to cut the thick world line twice with the current rice, I would hit the match Takinomiya 5-25 and really entered.

374
00:05:45,137 --> 00:06:00,168

It's fun. Once every few seconds.

378
00:06:45,120 --> 00:07:00,111
When I dropped 10 fun, I got ton ton ton at that Morse code.

379
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:15,119
I'm asking for help. It was united with.

00:07:45,116 --> 00:08:00,098
I'll be waiting for you duel. Somehow, it was just a Twitter-linked project.

383
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:15,124
Oh, it's over, maybe the project is cold. Anko steamed bun. What is that?

384
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:30,121
Miyako Manju. Virtual band.

A setting called a cane band. The school festival is on Twitter YouTube for its debut.

389
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:45,141
I arrived at Wilderness 100. I'll wear thick pants or 100 pieces. 3 days ago.

390
00:09:45,141 --> 00:10:00,152
It has been wiped out, but how do you wipe it out from here? That's 1000 in the world.

391
00:10:00,152 --> 00:10:15,149
For example, the shape of an individual V whose number of polygons increases with subscribers.

392
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:30,143
Daddy a little. Do you want to do it a little more? Project pizza. For some reason, the leader is completely.

394
00:10:45,111 --> 00:11:00,144
It's a little bit, but that's it. Eventually.

395
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:15,126
I do it once in a while. If there is only one Otaro, it will be the tray of the main character, so it's not like there are six Momotaro.

396
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:30,125

It's probably after 4 o'clock once. I think it's right, maybe.

444
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:30,098

449
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:45,158
Wobbuffet does not.

450
00:09:45,158 --> 00:10:00,149

The time has been shifted as much as possible. It will be hard to see if you wear it.

460
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:30,042

I've done it. Mother.

499
00:08:45,136 --> 00:09:00,150
I guess it's not a good idea to continue.

500
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:15,136
It's pretty easy to do.

501
00:09:15,136 --> 00:09:30,101
I can't get to 30,000, so if you notice. I've been to a litigation.

Is it on me?

527
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:45,083
I wonder if I should do it.

528
00:01:45,083 --> 00:02:00,127
I wonder if anyone is talking about this. I have no reply.

529
00:02:00,127 --> 00:02:30,142
Why don't you write it at all? What the hell let's quit this game.

538
00:05:00,077 --> 00:05:15,122
It's just a jigsaw puzzle.

539
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:30,124
I wonder why I make a mistake while talking. How about doing it while making comments?

540

566
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:15,139

00:02:30,115 --> 00:02:45,136
Mengen There is a rehearsal practice. Quotations There is a horizontal practice. It would be great if there was M 7 Kana Mengen-san.

587
00:02:45,136 --> 00:03:00,101
It's not a human employee, like a song frame.

588
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:30,125
puzzle. Tomorrow Together Mus That's right.

589

What should I do?

596
00:05:45,121 --> 00:06:00,111
Even though I heard this recommendation, I couldn't proceed with just sleeping. I want to move on a little.

597
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:15,078
I hope it will be a long delivery. It seems to be spicy.

598
00:06:15,078 --> 00:06:30,042
What should I do?

599
00:06:30,042 --> 00:07:00,149

601
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:45,105
It's not a horror game. Is it an infection? Puzzle Together That's right.

602
00:07:45,105 --> 00:08:00,130
Empress is crying. What kind of game is friction?

603
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:45,130
Come on to explain the team. I wrote that it would be a pretty bad situation, but it's too frank.

604
00:08:45,130 --> 00:09:15,114
This guy who decides the store. What kind of strength is this?

605
00:09:15,114 --> 00:10:00,121
The one who is making a sound. Elsa.

606
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:30,131
I'm really scared right now.

607
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:45,113
Robert is working hard on me right now.

608
00:10:45,113 --> 00:11:00,111
I'll try this. Bayonetta 2 I want to do it. In me.

609
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:15,106

La Vie.

614
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:30,128
Friction.

615
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:45,128
You see, my brother isn't sleeping either. Yaha Shiro on the door.

616
00:12:45,128 --> 00:13:00,113
When you do horror games, you get stronger when you take a bath. Otaba Cancellation I think my sister has been there normally. that.

617
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:15,126
Regardless of the restoration or whatever.

618
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:30,114
OUTLAST is really scary, isn't it? Well then. A little apepepepe yaro girlfriend at noon on Thursday.

619
00:13:30,114 --> 00:14:00,103
I have a game.

620
00:14:00,103 --> 00:14:15,110
Saturday. What?

621
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:30,120
I want to be late.

622
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:45,130
Julida. I wonder what to do.

623
00:14:45,130 --> 00:15:00,140
Is it a vine? Puzzle Together It looks like it's hard to prepare.

624
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,096
Marshmallows aren't open at all.

625
00:00:15,096 --> 00:00:30,120
Tohma Games.

626
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:45,088
Looking for a chef.

627
00:00:45,088 --> 00:01:00,120
You read something, right? If you do it.

628
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:15,148
Let's dye it, it's true. It's improvised and true. Actually, it's the one who makes a story.

629
00:01:15,148 --> 00:01:30,076
I'm sorry.

630
00:01:30,076 --> 00:01:45,126
Why don't you go? That's the story of the members.

631
00:01:45,126 --> 00:02:00,107
Then can the mash be marshmallows?

632
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:15,138
Where I lived in the stars Is it true using Venusians? Episode. It's like an etude. Everyone who posted one phrase will see it at random. It's a difficult story.

633
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:45,150
But that is. to see. Tezuka Crash Fever.

634
00:02:45,150 --> 00:03:00,130
That's because so many pompoms gather. It's a mystery-solving guy. It's half-life, the one that makes the portal.

635
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:15,146
I want to do that. The sharpness is amazing and the mouth is really real.

636
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:30,160
Just remember that you said yes. I'll go after Bayonetta 2 is over.

637
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:45,132
Also, maybe Bayonetta is in English. Because I read the subtitles.

638
00:03:45,132 --> 00:04:15,121
Is there Japan in Japan?

639
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:30,134
View from any country in the entire audience.

640
00:04:30,134 --> 00:04:45,104
Can you remember the tree buds? Member's sister.

641
00:04:45,104 --> 00:05:15,184
It's a certain standing pretend, but it's a nail because it's standing pretend. Is it the 1st of next month?

642
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:30,138
Next month 1. It's the end of the month, so I don't chat about picking up comments.

643
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:45,126
The waist is normal. The starred radio picks up comments messed up. Thank you very much.

644
00:05:45,126 --> 00:06:30,118
Rajiru Radio. Omoni was quick, so I asked him to do it.

645
00:06:30,118 --> 00:06:45,170
What should I do at night?

646
00:06:45,170 --> 00:07:00,081
I usually do it. That person is serious.

647
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:15,147
Eat delicious food.

648
00:07:15,147 --> 00:07:45,038
Then.

649
00:07:45,038 --> 00:08:15,115
I wonder if I should call Kudo.

650
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:45,083
Why at the time of the incident.

651
00:08:45,083 --> 00:09:00,116
I drew it. I won't play. What is the bacon case?

652
00:09:00,116 --> 00:09:15,142
6 types of pizza and 7 types. I was hungry when I was talking.

653
00:09:15,142 --> 00:10:00,139
I want to play Nagamachi gacha with everyone who is looking at the Nagamachi Memorial Frame.

654
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:15,134
But is there only Puzzle Together? I wonder if there is only Puzzle Together.

655
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:30,146
If you do. Is it from entering to the evening? Orleans.

656
00:10:30,146 --> 00:11:00,100
Don't worry, wait a minute.

657
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:15,214
I'm sorry, I have nothing to do.

658
00:11:15,214 --> 00:11:30,109
difficult. fall guys are probably that 60.

659
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:45,181
I don't think they'll get together because it costs 2050 yen each. Red Bull I still can't get it at all.

660
00:11:45,181 --> 00:12:00,142
40 people, right? I think it can be done for weeks if you do it on a scale of about 3. 2000 It's quite expensive.

661
00:12:00,142 --> 00:12:15,170
If you do it at the Hope Hall.

662
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:30,217
D 2 is. Tmall.

663
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:45,143
There are a lot of things I have to ask. I'm worried, but I wonder if there is only Puzzle Together.

664
00:12:45,143 --> 00:13:00,141
The puzzle together is something like this.

665
00:13:00,141 --> 00:13:15,126
Is it 9? It's expensive.

666
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:30,164
Daddy I heard that I had money to go to a convenience store yesterday, so I'm sorry I slept as it was.

667
00:13:30,164 --> 00:13:45,104
Even if it's a live server.

668
00:13:45,104 --> 00:14:30,038
It's fine, is not it.

669
00:14:30,038 --> 00:14:45,138
Maybe. What should I do? It's a smartphone.

670
00:14:45,138 --> 00:15:00,111
Something that everyone can do. me too.

671
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,204
Don't play, I can't sell my smartphone.

672
00:00:15,204 --> 00:00:30,129
Is it the best? It's because I used it in the commemorative frame even for Asobi Taizen.

673
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:45,143
Yes I'm good night now Good night Gunnai Gunnai. That's right now, it's decided from Arad PC to deliver.

674
00:00:45,143 --> 00:01:00,096
I don't have Fortnite and my family.

675
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:15,142
Knox has never been anything like that. Did I say yesterday too?

676
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:30,142
Because it wasn't free-to-play.

677
00:01:30,142 --> 00:02:00,141
Room tour with password really. Let's eat.

678
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:15,126
It says private match. You have to use a host account.

679
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:30,122
Fortnite Hello. It seems to be said.

680
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:45,131
It's true that it's an internal stps, isn't it? That's right.

681
00:02:45,131 --> 00:03:00,136
Android app. If there is, I want to see a relatively convenient one.

682
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:15,118
player. There is Amangas. It says that the Toda smartphone app can be played on a PC.

683
00:03:15,118 --> 00:03:30,057
But. interesting.

684
00:03:30,057 --> 00:03:45,229
Rough school expedition Good night everyone, thank you. I've heard the name. I can't even lose words.

685
00:03:45,229 --> 00:04:15,107
Oh this is.

686
00:04:15,107 --> 00:04:45,219
The whole thing in the Animal Tower Battle. Welcome back. I can manage to house.

687
00:04:45,219 --> 00:05:00,100
Ah, don't worry, what should I do?

688
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:30,138
Baba. But now.

689
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:45,140
60,000 people 70,000 people commemorative frame. I don't know what to say.

690
00:05:45,140 --> 00:06:00,139
I don't know if there is one.

691
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:15,180
Don't worry. Today I have no choice but to move out of the house puzzle, so it will be like this.

692
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:45,117
In the middle of hell miso soup.

693
00:06:45,117 --> 00:07:00,098
Marumo FPS TPS store.

694
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:15,184
It's like that.

695
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:30,110
7 Days to Die.

696
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:45,146
I did something similar on February 3rd.

697
00:07:45,146 --> 00:08:00,156
Timer. Reliance. Is it fun?

698
00:08:00,156 --> 00:08:15,114
I love you. I think I'm going to talk.

699
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:30,114
I can't hear it. I think I'm going to talk.

700
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:45,134
It's hard to get in because everyone who participates can hear English insanely. It was the strongest, though the bread was the strongest.

701
00:08:45,134 --> 00:09:00,152
Great Conan. Everyone speaks well. People who speak.

702
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:15,159
Then I turned off the sound and I can hear it. A sound that does not speak. I don't know what it is, I don't speak.

703
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:30,126
That's why it's delivered.

704
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:45,190
Let's do it without sound. Volume 05. The person who speaks like that is in a hurry.

705
00:09:45,190 --> 00:10:00,152
Use a pressure cooker. Where I can't hear. I don't know if it will be, so I'm a little scared.

706
00:10:00,152 --> 00:10:15,133
Don't worry a little. So this. When it comes to trying it with humans.

707
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:30,151
That's what it is. I'll cut the voice. That's right. Everyone on chat.

708
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:45,195
Something like this on a twig. Saka General War, so Sako My book. When will I have rice?

709
00:10:45,195 --> 00:11:00,167
Oh yeah Do you like Pineapple at?

710
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:15,102
I can't handle it either.

711
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:30,048
What should I do?

712
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:45,159
Well the commemorative frame. I want to simply eat in the bath.

713
00:11:45,159 --> 00:12:00,107
It's annoying.

714
00:12:00,107 --> 00:12:15,064
It's annoying.

715
00:12:15,064 --> 00:12:45,111
Well, I can do something like a drawing forest, so I'd like to have Mr. Tange. 70,000 people commemoration.

716
00:12:45,111 --> 00:13:00,098
One person commemoration.

717
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:15,128
60,000 70,000. It feels like it's round.

718
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:30,144
Oh yeah, I saw you selling plain pizza the other day.

719
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:45,134
Do you guys make pizza together? That's getting harder.

720
00:13:45,134 --> 00:14:00,112
It doesn't matter if you go shopping during your prosperity. I want to do it only for members. Niigata sake.

721
00:14:00,112 --> 00:14:30,094
Home pizza. I didn't eat pizza before. I want to eat.

722
00:14:30,094 --> 00:14:45,137
I want to go.

723
00:14:45,137 --> 00:15:00,125
There is a game called Uza Moon.

724
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,101
I'm like that. What kind of ozoni ingredients?

725
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:30,127
I'm worried about leftovers.

726
00:00:30,127 --> 00:00:45,111
That's why it's difficult because the games are limited. Demon King Hiroshima.

727
00:00:45,111 --> 00:01:00,146
What happens on this hall image on Saturday. Arrived around 15:00.

728
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:30,088
Good evening. Aren't you doing it?

729
00:01:30,088 --> 00:01:45,146
Do you charge 7 lost words? Monster Strike Gacha It's really astringent. Imakita eyelashes.

730
00:01:45,146 --> 00:02:00,141
Miyabi-kun song.

731
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:15,209
I enjoyed it until the beginning, but I want a character.

732
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:30,110
There seems to be reddit.

733
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:45,116
If you stay at some house, you think it's 2 Asakatsu.

734
00:02:45,116 --> 00:03:00,134
Shrimp Somehow, it's tsundere.

735
00:03:00,134 --> 00:03:30,101
I'm like this kind of story.

736
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:45,135
Oh yeah yeah yeah. It does not appear on the screen. Maybe on Twitter, give me this hashtag and URL.

737
00:03:45,135 --> 00:04:00,106
So together, it looks like you're looking at this one right now, so call me this.

738
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:15,193
The image is posted on Kanabunai Shinjo. Qanat. It's like whether it's interesting as a distribution.

739
00:04:15,193 --> 00:04:45,143
Tanaka It's like an image that can be put on the abolition. clearly.

740
00:04:45,143 --> 00:05:00,132
Is it Bayonetta?

741
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:15,112
Are you good at studying? It will be 10 soon.

742
00:05:15,112 --> 00:05:30,125
I don't. It came out.

743
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:45,203
I wonder what the copyright is. I'd like to try to solve it together, but the school problem isn't rolling.

744
00:05:45,203 --> 00:06:00,126
I don't really have time to do it. I'm having trouble taking the university exam.

745
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:15,139
If it was a national public. Did you do it?

00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:30,059

00:08:00,143 --> 00:08:15,125
Thank you. What should I do with the commemorative frame?

753
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:45,109
I think I will die except for science subjects.

754
00:08:45,109 --> 00:09:30,100
What is Momotaro that doesn't end until you remember it?

755
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:45,157
I can't remember Momotaro as a map of Japan.

756
00:09:45,157 --> 00:10:00,093
That's right.

757
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:15,091
Flowers are like 3 years. That's it. I'm already doing it. Thank you. That's why.

758
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:30,241

I see, there is such a thing. Don't worry, I can't assemble it at all.

760
00:10:45,134 --> 00:11:00,140
I'm also worried about snacks. What do you say?

761
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:15,123
When is that? Please pick up the comment. It's funny.

762
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:30,107
I wonder if rapid trains will repeat that kind of thing.

763
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:45,142
I want to be in such a neat place. Number 7 Dream Method I'm dead.

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:15,089
Because it's a collaboration with Muna.

766
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:30,130

769
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:15,142

00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:15,113
Even if I'm worried about various things, I can't decide for the rest of my life.

773
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:30,109

00:01:45,109 --> 00:02:00,123
Fold it in half. I wonder if I can only go up to 1 km.

782
00:02:00,123 --> 00:02:15,122
It's not a 6kg cheese pizza. 1 kg. Do S size.

783
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:30,154
It's M. 23 CM.

784
00:02:30,154 --> 00:02:45,146
I'm hungry.

00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:15,132
And up to 5 servings.

787
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:30,127

Fresh hot pizza + ice cold rice vest. Party Kanae chest.

792
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:45,133
If you eat slowly.

793
00:04:45,133 --> 00:05:15,137
This time. Before this, I made a tag because I was aiming to enter the trend.

794
00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:45,115
I'm sorry.

795
00:05:45,115 --> 00:06:00,146
If it was the level of making a bot.

796
00:06:00,146 --> 00:06:30,087
If you keep sending to tens of thousands of people. Is this a pizza party?

797
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:45,126
For 6 pizzas.

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:15,087
Maybe a pregnant woman.

800
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:30,096
It's liquor.

801
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:45,138
I wonder what the 42 of Mayo Sauce is.

802
00:07:45,138 --> 00:08:00,086
To 2.

803
00:08:00,086 --> 00:08:45,127
