1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:03:45,052
Ahhhhh.

2
00:03:45,052 --> 00:04:00,082
The rain.

3
00:04:00,082 --> 00:04:15,087
Let's make it cute.

4
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:30,108
Alright today. There are few villagers.

5
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:45,147
I thought I'd increase the number of villagers with guerrillas. I want to do it.

6
00:04:45,147 --> 00:05:00,098
It's about the beginning of Thursday I'm a little yes. I think I talked to you, remember. Not blown.

7
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:15,121
I'm expecting a little delivery recently. After all I have to keep what I went to.

8
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:30,124
Get out, you.

9
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:45,099
Hey, I'm very happy. I'm very happy I'm happy too.

10
00:05:45,099 --> 00:06:00,148
I'm happy with you. But I'm happy If I'm happy I'm happy You'll make this perpetual motion. Make a generator.

11
00:06:00,148 --> 00:06:15,125
There is no hoe.

12
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:30,130
There is no water bucket.

13
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:45,141
The weather is not good. After all, I admire perpetual motion as a blur.

14
00:06:45,141 --> 00:07:00,117
From that 0. The wind power generator is amazing.

15
00:07:00,117 --> 00:07:15,141
It's a little different because of the wind from the generator. For free.

16
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:30,087
You know, girls may not know. Mostly men.

17
00:07:30,087 --> 00:08:00,106
so. I want. I want to make a large-scale farmer.

18
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:15,104
I can't say that either. It's 4 squares, isn't it? 12 Instagram. Onimizu.

19
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:30,137
About once more.

20
00:08:30,137 --> 00:08:45,116
I wonder who I bought it now.

21
00:08:45,116 --> 00:09:00,134
Girl is tough. Do you decide?

22
00:09:00,134 --> 00:09:15,054
I wonder if it will be.

23
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:30,100
The house is pretty good. where. I was surprised that way.

24
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:45,122
Rub your sins with anything.

25
00:09:45,122 --> 00:10:00,092
Because it's paper. Don't bully me.

26
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:15,105
If you go to 1 million

27
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:30,134
Today in the dark, let's have a quiz to win my dinner today.

28
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:45,112
Gorgeous. Of 10 Chan on the shore. 30 seconds play compliment.

29
00:10:45,112 --> 00:11:00,108
You haven't eaten. eat.

30
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:15,147
What are you doing fried chicken? It's different, but that's fine, even if it's the correct answer. It's difficult today, it's difficult.

31
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:30,130
It's difficult, but you may not have eaten it before. Report that I ate.

32
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:45,132
It's not Yamada's addition, it's not the correct answer. 30 seconds left.

33
00:11:45,132 --> 00:12:00,149
Compliment. If it doesn't come out, it won't come out.

34
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:15,140
There is Yao Sea, but it's big.

35
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:30,044
that.

36
00:12:30,044 --> 00:12:45,115
everyone. It would be an option.

37
00:12:45,115 --> 00:13:00,100
Yoshizumi warmed up.

38
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:30,094
Pasta is different. Well. How about this villager absolutely.

39
00:13:30,094 --> 00:14:00,128
Build a pumpkin road.

40
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:15,080
Who made it, I'll break it.

41
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:30,095
Villager breeding machine voice.

42
00:14:30,095 --> 00:15:00,108
You only have to make the second stage. Yes my win.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,078
sorry. I'm sorry for everything.

44
00:00:15,078 --> 00:00:30,114
You are not bad at all. The tip of the nose.

45
00:00:30,114 --> 00:01:00,125
This is a sacrifice that requires pine trees.

46
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:15,150
With this, the villagers will run away.

47
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:30,131
Different place. Work if he is included.

48
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:45,111
Fill yourself up. Don't ask.

49
00:01:45,111 --> 00:02:00,052
Alright.

50
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:15,107
I went underground.

51
00:02:15,107 --> 00:02:30,051
you. you.

52
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:45,132
You guys have a bed over here.

53
00:02:45,132 --> 00:03:00,135
How about going to bed? Tateshina A little reset.

54
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:15,101
I wonder if this will come.

55
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:30,107
Because it's over. Clionidae.

56
00:03:30,107 --> 00:03:45,153
I want to increase the number of villagers somehow now.

57
00:03:45,153 --> 00:04:00,139
There may be rail tech.

58
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:15,091
Did you get graceful?

59
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:30,108
You a little. Let's throw some bread bread.

60
00:04:30,108 --> 00:05:00,044
I got it. You see.

61
00:05:00,044 --> 00:05:15,131
Also, don't do this with your kids. No, the door era is over.

62
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:30,118
I came, I came.

63
00:05:30,118 --> 00:05:45,038
There is.

64
00:05:45,038 --> 00:06:00,226
Oh yeah, it's the current door and that house judgment. new. Per one. A new era.

65
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:15,115
Then again.

66
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:30,088
That thing that became an adult. After that again. Open the world. Kitel Kitel.

67
00:06:30,088 --> 00:07:30,038
.. ..

68
00:07:30,038 --> 00:08:00,163
It's not something to do.

69
00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:15,133
It's changed.

70
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:30,257
But it was probably the latest.

71
00:08:30,257 --> 00:08:45,127
You can live in such a nether.

72
00:08:45,127 --> 00:09:00,106
Micra is amazing. But it will be 10 years.

73
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:30,120
It's still hot.

74
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:45,124
I'm Micra at all and I'm not very familiar with it. In terms of north style, the various games are played to some extent 4.

75
00:09:45,124 --> 00:10:00,130
I want to do it today. How much is it? It's not enough. Adults that aren't fast.

76
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:30,119
This is the only one in my village.

77
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:45,133
Miyabi I'm still there.

78
00:10:45,133 --> 00:11:00,134
The level was set to 2. This is. I'll fix this when I finish increasing the number of villagers.

79
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:15,157
I'm reborn, but is it nice? It's fine, is not it.

80
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:30,151
Okada was also changed and killed.

81
00:11:30,151 --> 00:12:00,136
Hustle Hustle Hustle.

82
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:30,108
skinny. It's amazing. You can do it. This is it.

83
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:45,133
After all, I long for the word fully automatic. full automatic.

84
00:12:45,133 --> 00:13:00,127
The poster is in the way. The composter is now.

85
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:15,115
So I wonder if I could make money or money and pick up something like that. To those who don't.

86
00:13:15,115 --> 00:13:30,131
That is a fully automatic yakitori.

87
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:45,158
The advertisement that I forgot to turn on Super Chat that appeared is also a bill. I'll be back later.

88
00:13:45,158 --> 00:14:00,091
What is it?

89
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:45,056
That is. Bone.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,103
Internal medicine. Aroma that is mellow.

91
00:00:15,103 --> 00:00:30,112
Insomnia Insomnia insomnia.

92
00:00:30,112 --> 00:01:00,108
Before you go to work, you guys. How about from the morning? A little from the morning.

93
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:30,153
It's about time to be another person. It's time for zombies, it'll be a while. Isn't it left?

94
00:01:30,153 --> 00:01:45,457
It's a rose. There is Matsuaki and it's okay.

95
00:01:45,457 --> 00:02:00,178
You can take down a thousand. I don't need this road. Don't let me go home.

96
00:02:00,178 --> 00:02:15,122
See you later. See you later. Where do you live

97
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:30,111
Who made that? 20. 2 to 0.

98
00:02:30,111 --> 00:03:00,132
I put it back. Change from off to on.

99
00:03:00,132 --> 00:03:30,109
Not good.

100
00:03:30,109 --> 00:04:00,096
This is not for work.

101
00:04:00,096 --> 00:04:30,113
Durian cider. I'm sorry today everyone just repeats this today. Increase it a lot.

102
00:04:30,113 --> 00:04:45,136
Repair gacha model. Master Villager Repair Gacha.

103
00:04:45,136 --> 00:05:00,105
Daiya wanted to write 2021, but in 2101.

104
00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:15,133
There must be at least an absolute dragon.

105
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:30,125
Absolutely. If you have money, 2101.

106
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:45,104
Actually. I wrote it at 4 o'clock. Thank you.

107
00:05:45,104 --> 00:06:00,119
Human breeder.

108
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:15,151
The word human breeder is correct. Something is that. Somehow, they are the people who multiply it.

109
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:45,146
What is a breeder? I tried using it. I said it was a top breeder, so it was 3.

110
00:06:45,146 --> 00:07:00,108
Super Chat Welcome back.

111
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:15,107
90,000 breeders. 100,000 top breeders. Oh.

112
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:30,143
Here, here, there, here, there, here, there, Esaka, there, there, there, there, there, there.

113
00:07:30,143 --> 00:07:45,134
At all. It's a long time. I don't like this.

114
00:07:45,134 --> 00:08:00,108
Let's disassemble it for the time being.

115
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:15,078
Of the villagers. Ummm. Work here.

116
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:30,159
What are you doing. It will be out around that time.

117
00:08:30,159 --> 00:09:15,133
Umeda I don't have a job today. Well I'm going to sleep again.

118
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:45,115
Hotel four people. Because there is.

119
00:09:45,115 --> 00:10:15,105
I was a man. 2.

120
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:30,099
Tsubasa who does not know whether to protect.

121
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:45,091
Anime. Stop motion animation. motion.

122
00:10:45,091 --> 00:11:15,132
King.

123
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:30,128
Jump at the same time. It will shift.

124
00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:45,128
short. The golem is boiling. The number of adults has increased. The number of adults has increased.

125
00:11:45,128 --> 00:12:15,131
That's why I'm after I come back. With or without.

126
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:45,096
Judged that there are many people. It does not work properly. That Katsusa.

127
00:12:45,096 --> 00:13:00,135
I'm the only person and I'm the only one. It doesn't work. It seems to work when made with spawn chunks.

128
00:13:00,135 --> 00:13:15,150
It seems like there are times when it doesn't work. What did you make? Somehow. I have one.

129
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:45,122
The forest ahead.

130
00:13:45,122 --> 00:14:00,088
There's tonight, so why not make a villager's habitat? 8.

131
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:30,060
Till what time.

132
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:45,133
Jump Jump Don't move this. It's early, actually.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,182
You've been there, don't you think?

134
00:00:30,182 --> 00:00:45,148
Part of. There may be a Micra Athletic tax.

135
00:00:45,148 --> 00:01:30,141
No, if you think about the future, this is definitely not the case. There is no camera shake when thinking about the future. All.

136
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:45,129
Ora Ora Ora. I have to have a diaper hustle. Rub against the wall.

137
00:01:45,129 --> 00:02:30,099
I bought a few sheep. In color.

138
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:45,140
Should I open a store?

139
00:02:45,140 --> 00:03:00,123
What is it? North gas leak.

140
00:03:00,123 --> 00:03:15,150
There is a bell. Why is it NG or off-color humor? Please stop the tree because your butt is barely there.

141
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:30,144
What is the memorial service?

142
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:45,147
I copied it out. I just logged out with the shovel.

143
00:03:45,147 --> 00:04:00,056
that.

144
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:15,108
It is a metamorphosis trying to connect to the bottom story immediately after that.

145
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:45,105
The bottom of the Christmas chestnut is a little.

146
00:04:45,105 --> 00:05:00,110
After the vaginal discharge started.

147
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:15,093
But let's do it.

148
00:05:15,093 --> 00:05:30,117
Metamorphosis was hidden. There is a metamorphosis.

149
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:45,051
Refusal.

150
00:05:45,051 --> 00:06:00,135
It's an incident. You will be pleased with whatever you do. Really.

151
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:45,048
so.

152
00:06:45,048 --> 00:07:15,116
Say it's full and go throw it away.

153
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:30,132
Is it? Wait for the drool.

154
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:45,111
I wonder if this is planted automatically.

155
00:07:45,111 --> 00:08:00,104
It seems that he will go up. There seems to be one. It seems to be inefficient.

156
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:15,165
To all supermarkets. I want to make fully automatic wheat.

157
00:08:15,165 --> 00:09:15,122
Honeywell.

158
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:30,052
surely.

159
00:09:30,052 --> 00:10:15,087
Let's sleep with the villagers.

160
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:45,125
The titles of the villagers are all. I want all the positions.

161
00:10:45,125 --> 00:11:00,166
Of course Nobunaga Oda and maybe a weapon. Hustle time.

162
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:15,113
But for the time being, all positions. How about this.

163
00:11:15,113 --> 00:11:30,151
That's right. What is it?

164
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:45,132
I'll kill Tar's Cafe.

165
00:11:45,132 --> 00:12:00,087
Holosters. do. Collaboration cafe.

166
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:15,055
What is it. said.

167
00:12:15,055 --> 00:12:30,133
Stop it. Boxer If you really do or do it.

168
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:45,098
what. What is that? You see.

169
00:12:45,098 --> 00:13:00,120
It's the current Curry River. This is it.

170
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:15,160
I'm definitely lending it. But I won't say that, of course.

171
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:30,156
It's not good, after all, when I said that all of this has already been announced, Kuroko Norikuradake This is it, but roll it up lightly.

172
00:13:30,156 --> 00:14:00,147
You see. I think it's difficult to raise a child, but I'm a child who works hard.

173
00:14:00,147 --> 00:14:15,116
Alright. Horror. A lot of people who make this village lively.

174
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:30,108
Look, look, look.

175
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:45,139
What do you do because it will be amazingly beautiful? Scissors scissors.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,121
What color would you like? Yellow at all.

177
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:30,109
This is the store on the first floor. Ricca's bed.

178
00:00:30,109 --> 00:01:00,123
I you guys.

179
00:01:00,123 --> 00:01:15,055
you.

180
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:45,144
Maybe in Paris 10. I think.

181
00:01:45,144 --> 00:02:00,169
So maybe one person has too much bread because it may not be enough. You see in Betsukai, you've just seen it.

182
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:15,133
Kyoto station.

183
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:45,144
There are so many of them. Speaking of white, what color is this product? That's why the color looks smart.

184
00:02:45,144 --> 00:03:00,137
It's red and white. Transplant appearance color.

185
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:15,118
In two colors, red and white. Imitate. It's time for Solamachi hat.

186
00:03:15,118 --> 00:03:30,051
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes.

187
00:03:30,051 --> 00:04:00,138
Rena Kuramochi.

188
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:15,123
That's really something for all ages.

189
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:30,051
And here.

190
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:45,144
About 3 rows of cats and 4 horsetails are 4. Here is. A factory in the future that can be done with boxes.

191
00:04:45,144 --> 00:05:15,142
I lie down 123 I lie down in 4 squares. At the 6-child store 6. Depth.

192
00:05:15,142 --> 00:05:30,123
4 times 6. 4 times 6 stores should be built in large quantities. Qoo 789.

193
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:45,141
Daddy's bed is free in Chapter 9. There is no more place to sleep. Hey.

194
00:05:45,141 --> 00:06:15,137
8. First of all, on the outside. There is an outer wall school. What is the height?

195
00:06:15,137 --> 00:06:30,131
2345. this is.

196
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:45,099
Beautiful. I want to be fashionable. The librarian is just the head.

197
00:06:45,099 --> 00:07:00,122
Try using squid.

198
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:15,091
That may change the story.

199
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:30,105
Not enough at all.

200
00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:45,171
If you say red, white, red, and white, the story changes. Try turning the pillars red.

201
00:07:45,171 --> 00:08:15,067
so. Then it's over here.

202
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:30,118
Words Unbalance Unbalance makes money.

203
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:45,100
I hid it here.

204
00:08:45,100 --> 00:09:00,131
Disagreeable. This is it once.

205
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:15,128
The floor and floor are replaced.

206
00:09:15,128 --> 00:10:00,102
Haikyu It's Haikyu time It's the strongest time. Good luck.

207
00:10:00,102 --> 00:10:15,084
Please do your best to make children. Half a block.

208
00:10:15,084 --> 00:10:30,122
Hand lock Hand 67 Half block Half block. 3 blocks.

209
00:10:30,122 --> 00:10:45,130
Good night theme. ease on you the same.

210
00:10:45,130 --> 00:11:15,139
What kind of image is Weapon Yo-san? Weapon shop.

211
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:30,125
That's why this someone made it.

212
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:45,104
No, I want to make it from that sheep's hair.

213
00:11:45,104 --> 00:12:00,119
You want it to be meaningful.

214
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:15,109
Walking sideways is long. Toyama Arsoriso There is also rice, isn't it?

215
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:45,125
I don't play a lot of games. If you think you might be thinking.

216
00:12:45,125 --> 00:13:00,133
It looks like the house is bad. It's about an hour, so maybe that's the reason.

217
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:15,159
It's hard for people to prepare this game, even if they like games.

218
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:30,148
Who thinks there is such a place in such a place. I'll put it in.

219
00:13:30,148 --> 00:13:45,087
A little. A little lucky.

220
00:13:45,087 --> 00:14:15,099
It has increased.

221
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:30,103
Minecraft turtle cow character.

222
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:45,160
Picasso has hit something so much now, who was it, maybe we.

223
00:14:45,160 --> 00:15:00,080
Okuda Nare. Peko I'm me.

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,211
I remember putting it in while thinking that I would forget it.

225
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:45,123
That's it, I'm running out of it.

226
00:00:45,123 --> 00:01:00,143
I wonder if I don't have enough beds anymore. 2345.

227
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:15,100
Lock. Chapter 112.

228
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:30,049
Alright.

229
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:45,121
Hang in there. I wonder if it's about a game. Because it increased by 50.

230
00:01:45,121 --> 00:02:00,137
It's my first look at it. Let's make another one.

231
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:15,139
Is it a lectern? this.

232
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:45,127
Where is it? I'm in Sendai. That there is a book.

233
00:02:45,127 --> 00:03:00,114
That you have toothpaste.

234
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:15,137
Few. There are overwhelmingly few cows.

235
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:45,184
Because this is the egg, it lays eggs, so when you lay eggs, you can't help it.

236
00:03:45,184 --> 00:04:00,129
Hey, this magma is this subtly this is really really hot I have only a hot head, but I'm not dead. Yakitori.

237
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:15,054
you.

238
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:30,099
Still a little. I have my own skin. Everyone gave birth to a child.

239
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:45,124
You and this new generation. Kakuranger. Hard work.

240
00:04:45,124 --> 00:05:00,132
It's episode 9.

241
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:15,139
Everyone is natural. Nakazato: It looks like that villain after I put it out.

242
00:05:15,139 --> 00:06:00,119
Bookshelf Look. Hairdresser.

243
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:15,134
It's time to eat, everyone.

244
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:30,135
From that point. If you think you can get bread, the table is up.

245
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:45,127
It's that easy, I wish I could open it, because children would come. Children make a double structure that is okay to come.

246
00:06:45,127 --> 00:07:30,135
The person who got a job.

247
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:45,137
Erabareshi. Quantization error.

248
00:07:45,137 --> 00:08:00,049
Good good good.

249
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:30,127
Flowering after adding another one.

250
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:45,132
Where did i go

251
00:08:45,132 --> 00:09:15,112
There will be no escape.

252
00:09:15,112 --> 00:09:45,132
At night.

253
00:09:45,132 --> 00:10:15,097
I can't come here. It's already in.

254
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:30,106
I went to bed at night.

255
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:45,111
That guy was early.

256
00:10:45,111 --> 00:11:00,235
Job hunting Job hunting boat. Job hunting boat 2.

257
00:11:00,235 --> 00:11:15,241
I made a mistake, waiting and waiting. Yuzu.

258
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:45,120
When the night came, you guys went to bed. From the beginning. Stupid human.

259
00:11:45,120 --> 00:12:00,096
Mataro.

260
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:15,105
Autumn color Autumn color Get on the boat.

261
00:12:15,105 --> 00:12:30,135
When I escaped, I should always come back to the splash someday.

262
00:12:30,135 --> 00:13:15,127
That's why. It may have been done.

263
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:30,038
Alright. so.

264
00:13:30,038 --> 00:13:45,097
OK secured.

265
00:13:45,097 --> 00:14:00,042
Good night.

266
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:15,045
here we go.

267
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:45,108
First, make it colorless.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,118
No way this is another.

269
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:30,117
Hey.

270
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:45,078
The curse of extinction. I do not need.

271
00:00:45,078 --> 00:01:00,099
It's cool though. Repair Silk touch is a stop.

272
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:15,041
Repair Silk touch is a stop.

273
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:30,121
Drop increase Drop increase.

274
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:45,099
It's rolling.

275
00:01:45,099 --> 00:02:00,132
Fine. Only the sound became a little.

276
00:02:00,132 --> 00:02:15,117
Villager gacha is in progress.

277
00:02:15,117 --> 00:02:30,102
Underwater breathing. PES 5th place 3 songs.

278
00:02:30,102 --> 00:02:45,047
knock back.

279
00:02:45,047 --> 00:03:00,091
Is it raining? Hi I'll return this. I think you can guess.

280
00:03:00,091 --> 00:03:15,216
You just have to be aware of it. It's a silk touch that won't disappear when you make a deal 14.

281
00:03:15,216 --> 00:03:45,121
You should break the left side.

282
00:03:45,121 --> 00:04:15,094
Trade it into a zombie and treat it.

283
00:04:15,094 --> 00:04:30,141
Even if you break your stomach, your food won't disappear. This way.

284
00:04:30,141 --> 00:05:00,090
That's right. Even with wool, mermaids are pretty soon.

285
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:15,081
Increased shooting damage 5.

286
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:30,094
Metropolitan Expressway.

287
00:05:30,094 --> 00:05:45,113
Silk touch is bent, because even if you have experience points, you can get it. Charge me out.

288
00:05:45,113 --> 00:06:15,096
Insect special attack. The rest is pretty strong.

289
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:30,060
No more.

290
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:45,137
The person who understands.

291
00:06:45,137 --> 00:07:00,129
Haikyu. There are quite a few things like 963.

292
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:15,143
I'm sorry for him, even though he sometimes spins around.

293
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:30,126
Damage reduction. Breeder. YES.

294
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:45,117
Human breeder knight. 36.

295
00:07:45,117 --> 00:08:00,098
36. The repairs are worth it.

296
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:15,045
OK. Mom.

297
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:45,042
Alright with this. It's okay.

298
00:08:45,042 --> 00:09:15,105
Open. Hey hey. In poster night suspension.

299
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:30,102
Good night. So really. You grew up, didn't you?

300
00:09:30,102 --> 00:10:00,040
with this.

301
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:15,141
Which one is it? Face Now I have to drop it there as well.

302
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:30,123
Because there is work that must be returned. Daddy with pumpkin and watermelon.

303
00:10:30,123 --> 00:11:00,135
I have to store my important books. An important container.

304
00:11:00,135 --> 00:11:15,104
This time torch.

305
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:30,141
Let's talk in Tokuyama. There is coal.

306
00:11:30,141 --> 00:12:00,043
This time.

307
00:12:00,043 --> 00:12:15,151
I'm working without it because it's open to the public, but I'll wait for this. If you make all the art. I'll open the lid and open it to the public.

308
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:30,118
It will be a busy city. Even though the drive is divided.

309
00:12:30,118 --> 00:12:45,164
I'm afraid this kind of thing.

310
00:12:45,164 --> 00:13:15,141
I'm hungry.

311
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:30,119
I'm pretty strong in ghost games, so horses are strong. But.

312
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:45,124
Occasionally. I'm sure I wouldn't buy it when my house gets stronger. There is nothing.

313
00:13:45,124 --> 00:14:00,098
Because it's impossible. I don't get scared of sudden aging in the middle of the night. It looks like it's a little scary.

314
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:15,128
You don't know. But I remember the scary horror I saw a long time ago.

315
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:30,098
Strange thing. Therefore, I think hard.

316
00:14:30,098 --> 00:14:45,130
Sometimes I get scared of getting out of my room. Do you really sympathize with it? There are 10 hikinitos.

317
00:14:45,130 --> 00:15:00,092
When you get this and that. Sit down.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,150
The most reminding is the voice.

319
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:30,133
Take a bath or something. I'm in a good mood. When opening the lid of the toilet bowl.

320
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:45,087
You may never have thought it was strong.

321
00:00:45,087 --> 00:01:00,136
Is it a part-time job? It's difficult to exchange emeralds without a farmer.

322
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:15,116
They are already this. Dispatch an adult man to the person. When I got home.

323
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:30,120
Let's get to work. Erotic suke.

324
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:45,142
Sky blue flowers. Armor shop or diamond armor.

325
00:01:45,142 --> 00:02:00,106
I'm scared in the bathtub.

326
00:02:00,106 --> 00:02:30,142
Sky Blue Let's make a sky blue house. Half block.

327
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:45,040
Hey hey hey hey.

328
00:02:45,040 --> 00:03:00,149
Brick or half block. You should work when it is still shaken.

329
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:15,127
Let's produce a lot of stickiness. You have to have it.

330
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:45,123
ASMR. ASMR.

331
00:03:45,123 --> 00:04:00,130
I think I'm happy with the weekend so I can do it next week. Civil engineering ASMR Noto.

332
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:15,107
Haven't you opened one between the shops?

333
00:04:15,107 --> 00:04:30,122
Get it. Do you chew vinyl?

334
00:04:30,122 --> 00:04:45,040
It was very nice.

335
00:04:45,040 --> 00:05:00,118
You won't go.

336
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:30,136
I wonder if it's connected to the bed over there.

337
00:05:30,136 --> 00:05:45,115
I'm leaving it.

338
00:05:45,115 --> 00:06:00,131
I wonder if this is okay and I'm connected over there.

339
00:06:00,131 --> 00:06:15,110
This is a bed.

340
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:30,118
When I work at night time, the villagers don't get up one by one.

341
00:06:30,118 --> 00:07:15,044
Good evening.

342
00:07:15,044 --> 00:07:30,114
It's a little plain if it's a single color. Accent Dolphin Accent. Isn't it bad?

343
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:45,143
Of armor. Not a weapon shop, but here next to the armor shop Nishio.

344
00:07:45,143 --> 00:08:00,084
Whatever it is, everyone is a material.

345
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:15,113
That? What is Kansai fabric?

346
00:08:15,113 --> 00:08:30,041
What is it?

347
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:45,098
Girl's. Coke soda blast furnace.

348
00:08:45,098 --> 00:09:00,043
Where.

349
00:09:00,043 --> 00:09:30,098
It's kind of like a Kamado. I don't know which one.

350
00:09:30,098 --> 00:10:30,113
Tanjiro. Te ...

351
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:45,038
stone.

352
00:10:45,038 --> 00:11:15,116
With a kamado and iron. Dolly with a kamado. Kamado.

353
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:30,076
Smooth stone. Smooth stone. Can be made of stone.

354
00:11:30,076 --> 00:12:00,160
Whether it is a private room in the Kamado, it is already resurrected. You will be lonely.

355
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:15,138
I wonder what it is. After many years.

356
00:12:15,138 --> 00:12:30,105
I want to see Netflix while rumbling, but at all. In general, those two are better-because I'm not lonely.

357
00:12:30,105 --> 00:13:00,099
The first diagonal business card I made.

358
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:30,132
Of overseas. Did you say that it would make it darker? I'm touching it.

359
00:13:30,132 --> 00:13:45,122
Total flow with a married couple. It's annoying.

360
00:13:45,122 --> 00:14:00,135
Just before you get up.

361
00:14:00,135 --> 00:14:15,140
Get up. It's early in the morning.

362
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:30,114
This is not possible with this hand.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,097
Two French people processed it.

364
00:00:15,097 --> 00:00:45,107
For employment war. A bird of the first generation.

365
00:00:45,107 --> 00:01:15,105
Yamamama. Anyway, it will be resolved.

366
00:01:15,105 --> 00:01:30,112
It's already gone missing again.

367
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:45,137
State. Congratulations on your employment You are an armor shop from today.

368
00:01:45,137 --> 00:02:00,107

00:02:15,046 --> 00:02:30,123
Alright, I'm right from today. you guys. Do you have the ability to work properly?

371
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:45,128
I'll give you a Yokote pet.

372
00:02:45,128 --> 00:03:00,117
The pet disappeared. I.

373
00:03:00,117 --> 00:03:30,133
You too. That's why the prices are different between you next door.

374
00:03:30,133 --> 00:04:00,108
Trousers and feet. All will come out.

375
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:30,141
I'm sure it's all armor in the end. I feel like I can do it, so is it a microphone? come.

376
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:45,051
Cairo.

377
00:04:45,051 --> 00:05:00,119
Two made.

378
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:15,106
Head over here Bed head over here? Write here tomorrow.

379
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:30,120
If you can fill it up. That is on the table.

380
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:45,154
Keisei was a bad ASMR microphone.

381
00:05:45,154 --> 00:06:00,124
1 million yen ASMR dummy head microphone. very well.

382
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:15,086
It's like a paranormal microphone. horror film.

383
00:06:15,086 --> 00:06:30,091
next. What the hell tomorrow. I can't do anything tight.

384
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:45,065
Domestic.

385
00:06:45,065 --> 00:07:15,158
ASMR song frame.

386
00:07:15,158 --> 00:07:30,208
Left and right, left and right. Can you hear it from Nishidai?

387
00:07:30,208 --> 00:08:00,146
Let's get it. Where is that? Shake your head.

388
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:15,127
I lowered the sound.

389
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:30,095
Stand up and face each other.

390
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:45,092
Fortune-telling is an image of medicinal herbs.

391
00:08:45,092 --> 00:09:30,140
Dark green 7. that.

392
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:45,115
I will deliver the satellite whole.

393
00:09:45,115 --> 00:10:15,117
62. Tool shop.

394
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:30,134
Black is also a little accent accent white.

395
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:45,116
Are you working?

396
00:10:45,116 --> 00:11:00,127
Hey. Owner Kishino Owner. Hey. You guys who live now.

397
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:15,128
I don't know when the customer will come. You said it was open 24 hours a day.

398
00:11:15,128 --> 00:11:30,131
Do you sometimes do it at night?

399
00:11:30,131 --> 00:12:00,038
one two Three.

400
00:12:00,038 --> 00:12:15,136
Speaking of which, Koko-chan forgot to change the floor. Is it a chance to sleep?

401
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:30,125
What about Yuka?

402
00:12:30,125 --> 00:13:00,101
Still home. To me.

403
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:15,048
so. wheat.

404
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:30,087
Do you want to turn the bed again? Don't go to bed soon.

405
00:13:30,087 --> 00:13:45,144
I'm not thinking that Gaku-san might come.

406
00:13:45,144 --> 00:14:00,142
Accent blue. White sheet music.

407
00:14:00,142 --> 00:14:15,108
Kis-My song.

408
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:30,131
I'll give it now too. With a width of 6 squares.

409
00:14:30,131 --> 00:15:00,113
Micra is fun. Pillow pillow I can do quite a lot.

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,096
Alright, let's go with this. Do you want to put it in?

411
00:00:15,096 --> 00:00:30,102
Micra is fun. It's interesting.

412
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:45,083
I'm going too far behind.

413
00:00:45,083 --> 00:01:15,120
It's interesting. From Haneda.

414
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:30,071
Will be done again.

415
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:45,061
Who made the girl's hole?

416
00:01:45,061 --> 00:02:15,115
It 's not good. so.

417
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:30,150
At the store. The times.

418
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:45,114
There is a motivated guy. Say you're ready to go.

419
00:02:45,114 --> 00:03:00,054
new.

420
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:15,108
8. How is the era?

421
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:30,089
There are no holes.

422
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:45,131
The two of us earlier. I don't remember.

423
00:03:45,131 --> 00:04:00,111
It's enough, but it's scarce. We are.

424
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:15,142
Almost saying that there is no more. Oh yeah?

425
00:04:15,142 --> 00:04:30,132
Resources are overwhelmingly scarce. I want to make it.

426
00:04:30,132 --> 00:05:00,128
Now. Well, first close here.

427
00:05:00,128 --> 00:05:15,122
Business boat.

428
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:30,115
In charge. People who are telling me to come by the first train.

429
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:45,094
Keep a distance between people.

430
00:05:45,094 --> 00:06:00,145
Really, see.

431
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:30,115
Congratulations You are a tool shop from today.

432
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:45,104
I'm glad. I wasn't working. What is your income?

433
00:06:45,104 --> 00:07:00,102
It means getting a job normally. How is your enthusiasm?

434
00:07:00,102 --> 00:07:15,128
Oh really. 24 hours of Yu-chan and Uchiwa.

435
00:07:15,128 --> 00:07:30,142
What is the bed in Ozu, Oita City? I'll leave it because it's called the government office. Since it is a rule, I will leave it, but please do not use it even though it is only today.

436
00:07:30,142 --> 00:08:00,131
Pro happiness, the one who survived. It will be a tool shop. Those who cannot board this ship will die. Pork radish.

437
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:15,117
It's raining like that. I haven't come.

438
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:30,117
I'll put it in the middle.

439
00:08:30,117 --> 00:09:00,057
You see. YOSHIKI.

440
00:09:00,057 --> 00:09:15,109
Please leave it.

441
00:09:15,109 --> 00:09:30,169
You are Meitetsu You have fallen Our company has fallen I understand.

442
00:09:30,169 --> 00:10:00,157
I would like to work. Ah, if I was told that much, I would be the same.

443
00:10:00,157 --> 00:10:30,118
Did you choose another path?

444
00:10:30,118 --> 00:10:45,113
If you go there, wash it.

445
00:10:45,113 --> 00:11:00,102
Become a legendary farmer.

446
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:15,133
After all. Instead of getting a mediation. I bought a job.

447
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:30,086
About 5 o'clock.

448
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:45,106
I'm 6 years old. so.

449
00:11:45,106 --> 00:12:00,123
Living with a shovel. Not bad. Which one is your pet? It looks good if you like Tamagotchi.

450
00:12:00,123 --> 00:12:15,153
I'm glad you guys. How about you guys

451
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:30,126
I also have a job. I can't thank you enough.

452
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:45,053
employee.

453
00:12:45,053 --> 00:13:00,152
How do you make a star?

454
00:13:00,152 --> 00:13:45,160
To be honest, it 's about this, is n't it?

455
00:13:45,160 --> 00:14:00,070
Because there is a large amount left.

456
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:30,121
Not with my dad.

457
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:45,099
Black gray.

458
00:14:45,099 --> 00:15:00,039
8.

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,092
Burnt stone half.

460
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:30,149
Let's build a house first.

461
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:45,081
In red. so.

462
00:00:45,081 --> 00:01:00,091
How to change the floor?

463
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:15,130
I wonder if I should be a pet.

464
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:30,048
so.

465
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:45,046
Yes yes. Yes Yes Yes.

466
00:01:45,046 --> 00:02:30,135
No wrong.

467
00:02:30,135 --> 00:03:00,102
Somehow red bone red old. It seems to write concentration. That's why it's better to meet. I wonder what the forest is.

468
00:03:00,102 --> 00:03:15,096
How do you do it?

469
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:30,075
The red wallet is 3.

470
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:45,123
It's not as purple as purple, though.

471
00:03:45,123 --> 00:04:15,077
I wonder if it has become a smooth stone. Yishiha.

472
00:04:15,077 --> 00:04:45,102
Something like that. The hand called purple is a little purple.

473
00:04:45,102 --> 00:05:00,135
I wonder what it is. It's like later.

474
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:15,140
I haven't seen the house after a while.

475
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:30,157
We are looking for people who want to hit. Please. I'm looking forward to it.

476
00:05:30,157 --> 00:05:45,118
Morning salad is expected.

477
00:05:45,118 --> 00:06:00,044
Four. after.

478
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:30,089
Congratulations on you from today. There is. Waka.

479
00:06:30,089 --> 00:07:00,095
That's right. until now. I made it.

480
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:15,145
I wasn't there.

481
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:30,100
Don't miss this.

482
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:45,049
let me in. Break.

483
00:07:45,049 --> 00:08:00,125
Employment Employment.

484
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:15,085
Modere salon. You guys are human beings from today. Until now.

485
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:45,178
The masters who will use it the most, I can't keep up with the rain and wind, that person. Because it's excellent.

486
00:08:45,178 --> 00:09:00,141
If you don't say it, you can't sell it unless you apply for it.

487
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:30,121
Thank you for the photo. Farmer.

488
00:09:30,121 --> 00:10:00,081
8. I have to do it.

489
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:30,050
OK. We arrived.

490
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:45,116
You're already a veteran. But I don't know.

491
00:10:45,116 --> 00:11:00,153
I don't know lunch. Have you been chosen? Then, the farmer's sentence so far is that sentence.

492
00:11:00,153 --> 00:11:15,079
The curse is you. On the boat.

493
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:30,047
do it.

494
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:45,107
Alright this is fine.

495
00:11:45,107 --> 00:12:30,113
Because there is. I wanted to bring Micra, but it's annoying.

496
00:12:30,113 --> 00:12:45,038
First of all.

497
00:12:45,038 --> 00:13:00,124
Congratulations.

498
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:15,122
Still it.

499
00:13:15,122 --> 00:14:00,149
Alright. With ogi seedlings. Stop zebra and bread Rokko.

500
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:15,111
I wonder if there are many emeralds. If you have a pumpkin.

501
00:14:15,111 --> 00:14:30,052
whatever.

502
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:45,124
With three. Hey. pumpkin.

503
00:14:45,124 --> 00:15:00,135
If you have a pumpkin, that's fine.

504
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,095
I wish I had a pumpkin.

505
00:00:15,095 --> 00:00:30,146
A higher-grade watermelon rokok is the ideal person.

506
00:00:30,146 --> 00:00:45,029
pumpkin.

507
00:00:45,029 --> 00:01:00,125
Purchase and purchase.

508
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:30,106
If I come, it's morning or something, but if time goes by, I'll come back again.

509
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:45,115
Donald's supply no problem.

510
00:01:45,115 --> 00:02:00,123
Of repair. I want to raise the level even more.

511
00:02:00,123 --> 00:02:15,077
To raise the level. Return it.

512
00:02:15,077 --> 00:02:45,130
That's it. There is no choice but to collect metal recovery.

513
00:02:45,130 --> 00:03:00,107
Automatic.

514
00:03:00,107 --> 00:03:15,041
this.

515
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:30,118
I laughed.

516
00:03:30,118 --> 00:04:15,114
Because watermelon is important.

517
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:30,118
Watermelon is highly efficient, so emerald.

518
00:04:30,118 --> 00:04:45,113
The sticker I'm buying.

519
00:04:45,113 --> 00:05:15,083
I'd like a pumpkin too.

520
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:45,116
It's a little over 1 o'clock. But maybe it hasn't come out yet.

521
00:05:45,116 --> 00:06:00,089
No, the delivery is solo. I'll get up a little more today. Good night Kishidou human breeder theme theme.

522
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:15,129
My sister inspiration. Gunnai. OK.

523
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:45,143
Because it's an empty building part. Architectural part While building.

524
00:06:45,143 --> 00:07:00,103
If you get a good ax or something, that's it. I wanted to build my house. The place where the space and flowers grow is more luxurious.

525
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:15,143
I wonder if it will lead to raising the overall level. Also when collecting trees.

526
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:30,115
I would like to end here today. Aluminum. I'll make it again after waking up tomorrow morning.

527
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:45,107
Because I won in the back in Edogawa Ward.

528
00:07:45,107 --> 00:08:00,115
Thank you for the end, everyone.
